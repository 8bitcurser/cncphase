## ForewordForewordForewordForeword

Welcome to CROWN and SKULL, a new RPG system and setting
created from hundreds of hours of play in several player groups over a
three-year period. My groups are always seeking new ways to play. This
book represents a coalescence of our latest and greatest themes, mechanics,
monsters, and mapless maps.

The system here will prove a signifi cant departure from the deeply ingrained
‘D20’ genre that has seen such meteoric growth in recent years. As such,
settle in for a brain-tickling ride into new mindsets and methods. If you feel
a bit challenged by the player-focused aspects of the system, that means
you’re in the sweet spot. This may be that long-overdue moment you and
your group break into new territory.

No small amount of inspirational credit must be given to Steven Peterson
and his team on Fantasy Hero 1st edition (1985), Steve Jackson and the
GURPS team (1986), and David Wesely/Dave Arneson and their realms
of Braunstein/Blackmoor (1969/1971). These creations were my initiation
into role-playing, along with many others, and made a formative mark on
my young mind. Also, Into the Odd (Chris McDowall) and Cairn (Yochai
Gal) must be mentioned for their infl uences. Veterans of those rules and
worlds will see their ghosts fl itting here and there in the pages ahead, but
in spirit only. No one artifact of those brilliant works can be found here, nor
is any compatibility or direct link inferred or included.

Special and infi nite thanks go to my stalwart players: The Council of Magi,
Dirty Jobs, The Cypher Rebellion, and The Immortals. They are the soil in
which this game grows. Their patience and incredible role play gave rise to
many of the dark and hopeful truths in these pages.

Settle in with pen and journal, mighty reader, and let me tell you of the
days after the Bloodwing War, when nations fell and shadows sharpened.
This is The North Holds, and there are few roads here...

_Ever grateful, ever strong
-Runehammer_


I’ve known Brandon (Runehammer) as a friend, a player, and a GM for
many years, and we’ve had some wondrous adventures together. Naturally,
when he started telling the Council of Magi about a new game he was
working on, we were all stoked and ready to dive in. This was early 2022,
and we were already playing weekly online. Thus began, for me, CROWN
and SKULL.

When we started playing, the game was far from fi nished. Details about the
world and the game mechanics were being added every session... written
and revised as we played. We made and remade our characters with each
update, kept the good parts and tossed the bad, all while exploring The
North Holds and its dark secrets.

This game has sparked the feeling I had when I was a kid: exploring every
game I could get my hands on. Both as a ‘C&S’ player and GM, I got to
witness depth and richness grow around us with every game night. Our
actions, our choices, our failures became the ‘lore’ of the setting.

Our little invented truths became legends.

We all pitched in as the system and the setting were slowly refi ned into a
solid ingot. It has been an amazing ride watching B forge what you now
hold in your hands.

This book is pretty dense by RPG standards, and thick with story. I urge
you to **_soak_** in this tome like a hot spring high in the mountains.

By all means jump right in and start playing, but remember to **_breathe_** the
ink from these pages and simply **_exist_** here as you roll the dice.

_Play hard, love deep, and live happy
-JD Stirling_

GUIDE

'


Castigere drifted down from the lichen-choked stones, weightless, white
robe waving in a centuries-lost breeze. His transparent form was luminous,
but waning with each moment. The light of elder days was failing, even
in the vapors of a ghost. Without sound he alighted, holding out a gentle
hand to Adelaide. She knew no fear in his presence, no matter what realm
he hailed from, living or dead... Castigere was her teacher, her patron, her
saint. His presence was like a cool spring on a warm day.

“Addy, you hang your head so low, what troubles you?” The voice was
reverberant, distant. The sound was barely a whisper, loud as thunder.

“Father, I have just had a waking dream, a veil pulled over my eyes on
a morning walk... the wandering mist couldn’t cool me. I couldn’t wake
from the fl ight of it. My feet barely touched the road. It was... terrible.”

“You have always had a gift for far-sight, Adelaide. The Great One has
given you the eyes of an eagle. What do you see?”

“A world in gloom and candlelight. Spider webs on hillock heaped, and
Ruinmoor howling with dead wind. The bones of dragons dead and gone,
a tree soaked in blood, creaking ropes, lightless water, and sinister laughter
in catacombs dim.”

“Your time in the abbey is coming to an end. We live in an age of leaning
stone and crumbling rooftops, and your stout heart is needed... out there...
out on those vanishing roads...” Castigere looked out across the Fairfi eld
Hills. The icy summit of Folson’s Peak was bright in the early day; even
the gloomy Shadow Glades had sun-kissed treetops.

She didn’t want to, but she nodded, acknowledging the truth of Castigere’s
council. She was a student no more. Her vision was all-too simple, a thinly
hidden view of the subconscious... it was, in a word, fear. This fear she
compacted, tucked away in a shadowy corner... watched as Catigere’s
ethereal form drifted and dissipated like a plume of white butterfl ies.
The sun crested the ridge, sending long, angular rays into the valley. The
chimneys of Slimshire hosted lazy tendrils of breakfast smoke.

## A Leaning StoneA Leaning StoneA Leaning StoneA Leaning Stone


The abbey was behind her now, a mile up the zig-zagging trail, blue with
distance, tiny against the darkening sky. A storm was gathering, billowing
down from Stonemark. It was seldom this cold in spring, but the wind had
a bite that kept her cloak wrapped snug.

Ahead, the waymarker of Saint Sarraf, a blocky oblong of granite, leaned
to one side. It had stood for over 300 years in this spot, but each year the
monolith sagged further. It was a disquiet feeling to see such a mass of rock
at such a pitch... as if it could topple and end the age of light at any second.
Past this Adelaide walked. Her bundle was simple: great sword in a cloth-
clad scabbard, wool blanket, a gourd fl ask carved with leaves, then camping
pouch and nested daggers. Th igh boots were perfect in this cool air, and
her chain was kept quiet by a Fairfi eld arming coat and tabard. Black and
white were her sleeves, bunching at the gauntlet. Her brown hair she let fl y,
walking alone and putting on no airs.

Before the descent to town and whatever this crumbling world would
call upon her, she stopped, leaning on the guard of the broad blade like a
drunk at the tavern, looking back at Sarraf ’s stone. Th e breeze caught her
pommel-banner, a bright red strand of cloth. In that moment, the world
had never felt so immense, so ripe with danger, so dark with dooms yet
hidden. Th ere were no spear-guards walking the old roads, no borders, no
toothless scholars giggling at the crossroads, no lantern-lit shelves of books
kept. Time had been cruel to the realm, and when a thing is wounded, it is
delicate as a sparrow’s wing.

Someone had to protect what was left of these lands. Someone had to
nurture them back to health, to believe former heights within reach, to rally
the stumbled, to burn away the webs. She smiled to herself, proud, feeling
Castigere’s ghost in those thoughts.

Across hill and dale, beyond river and mountain, above marsh-soaked
lows and in stone-walled mazes beneath the world, all Adelaide feared was
stirring, and planning, and seething, and growing with evil power.

If the realm was to be saved from those dripping fangs, it would not be easy.

Before we dive into the process of imagining an entire world, numerous
storylines, possible heroes and villains, game mechanics, character
concepts, and how it will all come together, let’s get our footing.

Whether you’re new to tabletop role playing, or a battle-scarred veteran of
yesteryear, all good games begin with the same phrase...
_‘...wouldn’t it be cool if...’_

Every day, we dream of things we crave. Whether it be that fi rst cup of
coffee, our last day of fi nals, slaying at the gym, or fi nishing a project.
We visualize the outcomes of daily life or set our wills to hard work, and
then the magic happens: we imagine _other_ things. We daydream about
wide-open fi elds, trackless wilderness, friends clanging mugs in lantern-
lit taverns, freedom and exploration, swords fl ashing and heroism well-
earned. For fantasy fans everywhere, this is a daily exercise... dreaming of
a world of adventure.

If you do this, you’re ready to role play. If you’ve role played before and
you fi nd yourself dreaming of worlds beyond our own, it’s time to get back
into the hobby. You, my friend, like me, are ripe with the substance of role
playing: _concepts_.

Role playing concepts are the simple foundation that you’ll bring to
CROWN and SKULL. You’ll imagine yourself in each scene, your friends
emerging from the landscape, your own details adding to a ‘living’ view of
an imaginary universe. All the muscles of reading a great novel will serve
you well here: translating words into images, and images into emotions.
How do you fi t into it all? Wouldn’t it be cool if it was _you_ in this story?
This time, it _is_ you.

Role playing games have been around in the form we know them today
since the late 1960’s. There’s no need to get too deep into a ‘what is role
playing?’ discussion. Just get those daydreams in your head, see yourself
in the pages to come, and you’ll be ready for anything.

## Concepts & ContentConcepts & ContentConcepts & ContentConcepts & Content


```
Hail, reader. My name is Hankerin Ferinale, a
mountain dwarf, intellectual, painter, fi sherman,
brewmaster, cheese connoisseur and former
battle commander. I’ll be weighin’ in on the text
here and there, so mind ye my council!
```
The real skillset of role playing is the translation of concepts into playable
content. Anyone can imagine themselves slaying a dragon with a silver
sword. The art of the gaming hobby is codifying that scene into risks and
uncertainties... making a gamble of it all, and seeing what happens. That
art falls on you, dear reader, whether player or gamemaster (GM).

**World:** Much of this book portrays a world... The North Holds. This vast
space is our backdrop, but its details are far more than stage setting. The
world provides its own invitations, dilemmas, and challenges. Answering
those calls is usually what sets things in motion.

**Characters:** Players change concepts into content by building mechanically
sound and emotionally compelling characters. Heroes, hermits, and
explorers all play their part... giving the world life.

**Enemies:** Before our heroes can do whatever they please, they’ll have foes
to contend with. The GM will hurl all manner of monster at you. Is there
any way around? Any hope? When is the sword the only choice?

**Dice:** To resolve the friction at play here, it’s time to roll dice. We can sway
the results a bit, but there’s no telling what will happen.

**And then...** After the dice have spoken, we’ll have to update our scene,
change our perspective, take in new circumstances and press on. How we
confront all this together is the _content_ of a great tabletop game.

## Concepts & ContentConcepts & ContentConcepts & ContentConcepts & Content


In many RPGs, the game master is an ever-deeper source of almost
everything at the table besides role play and decision making. In combat,
this becomes even more apparent, as a GM is often ‘thinking’ for numerous
monsters and environmental hazards, making lots of rolls, and even assisting
players with their roll targets and hoped-for output values. This can lead
to a cognitive overload for GMs, but it is considered acceptable, as GMs
are often the most enthusiastic about the hobby in general. In CROWN and
SKULL, there is an intrinsic call to players: _you are now the focus!_

The term ‘player facing’ in the role playing hobby refers to rolls and
mechanics that do not require input or answers from the GM. Rather,
players need only consult their own sheet and resources, personal and
unique to them, to make rolls, attempt actions, attack foes, and determine
the output values of their work. Rather than asking _‘what’s my target on
this roll?’_ the player always knows the answer, rolling in the context of
their skills and equipment.

Just knowing what you’re trying to roll is hardly a robust ‘player facing’
game, though. Here’s where you, dear reader, are called upon to step up as
a CROWN and SKULL player. In this game, there are numerous aspects
aimed squarely at you. Let’s start with the ‘soft’ elements:

**Acquiring Player Expertise:** An expert player doesn’t just stay focused
on the game, expedite turn time, lift up other players, and role play with the
best of ‘em. Player expertise is also found in a deep comprehension of the
mechanics and thematics in the game. This comes with time and attention.

**Gathering Character Knowledge:** Your character will gain knowledge of
foes, treasure, magic, politics, geography and more as they grow. This area
is entirely your purview... the GM won’t remember to remember what you
may or may not remember.

**Finding Synergy:** Throughout this book, there are numerous easy-to-miss
interconnections. The masterful player fi nds and exploits these synergies
with style and effect, making the most of the many details given.

## A Player FocusA Player FocusA Player FocusA Player Focus


Beyond the soft skills of a player focused game experience, we have the
more mechanical expectations of this system...

**Making Rolls:** Since the GM has far fewer rolls to make, the player will
fi nd themselves making a great deal more rolls throughout play. This
places the burden of speedy play on the player! Rolling Defense to avoid
a Formian mandible bite? Be ready, knowing what your target is, where
your D20 is hiding, and the like. Knowing the ins and outs of your sheet
becomes far more important when you are making 5 times the rolls of the
GM. It also means there is seldom a dull moment.

**Building Elements with Points:** It’s one thing to play skillfully within given
elements and things-from-the-book. CROWN and SKULL takes ‘player
facing’ to a whole new level by entrusting players with the construction of
new and emergent elements of play by granting _hero points_. These points
can be earned in many ways, and they allow you, the player, to invent
spells, equipment and other progression abilities as play proceeds.

Who is the best designer of an RPG? The people playing it! If this level
of involvement feels intimidating, you can always play what’s written. Go
with your gut.

CROWN and SKULL has total trust in the player. Th e more you explore
this book, the more that should become apparent, and (I hope) off er you
new vistas of creativity in your sessions and evolution.

## The North Holds

C **ROWN and SKULL** takes place in a realm called The North Holds.
This vast, diverse landscape is fi lled with cultures, secrets, and dangers for
you to explore. It is a dark time, but thanks to you, there is always hope.

**The North Holds** are recovering from a terrible time of calamity. Some
30 years before present day, The Bloodwing War ravaged the realm. The
once-unifi ed lands no longer have a king, borders have decayed, wilds are
more dangerous than ever. An age of order and ideas has come to an end.
With no unifying rule, The North Holds struggle to fi nd new purpose and
new direction. An era of adventure.

**Bloodwing** was a colossal green dragon, driven mad by a slime-entity
called The Corruption. Since his rampage of desolation, dragons are widely
feared by all but the elves of Dragon Tooth, and seldom seen. Only the very
old remember a time when dragons and mortal folk were allies.

**A formless evil** has been creeping into the world since the fall of
Bloodwing. It is not fully understood, but the dreams of mortal folk are
darkening. Rumor holds that the lord of Blood Manor is somehow behind
this growing shadow. This is a mysterious fi gure known as Lord Royce,
said by doomsayers to be ‘he who would drink the world.’

Despite all this, **good yet has a foothold**. Three once-tiny towns are on the
rise with renewed ambition... havens for a new generation of adventurers.
Long-standing tyrannies are being worn away by courageous defectors.
The light challenges the darkness to retreat, and asks every soul in The
Holds: will you choose the Crown, or the Skull?

**An irrevocable choice.** As you grow and explore The North Holds during
play, at some point a lord, king or elder wizard will offer you access to
once-forbidden realms of knowledge and power. To make this exciting step
in your journey, you will face a choice that can never be undone... you
must choose either the CROWN or the SKULL. Both paths have secrets
and skills to teach. Choose wisely! There are many foes of both sides in
the wide world...

## The North HoldsThe North HoldsThe North Holds


## Hometowns

If you’re looking over The North Holds world map, you may feel a bit
lost. Who are we? Where are we, and why? CROWN and SKULL is a
bit different from many RPGs, in that players can only begin the game in
one of three possible locations. Your Hometown will defi ne the feel and
opening events of your game, and nearby areas accessible by foot travel.

**Gardenburrow, Forest Refuge:** This town was founded by elves centuries
ago as a waystation for forest caretakers and foragers. Since then, it has
grown to a few hundred residents and many travelers crossing the West.
To call this town home, you’ll be diving into mysterious forests, a long-
standing feud with frog men, tensions with dwarves, and the mists of the
Emerald Narrows. Gardenburrow is an elemental place... a pilgrimage for
druids and nature-folk of the realm.

**Rivergate, Bustling Trade City:** At the geographic center point of The
North Holds is the port city of Rivergate. This central location has made
the ruling elite here wealthy, trading with the Stormkeeper dwarves and
the abundant farms south of the River Thenne. Now that Ruinmoor has
gone quiet, though, Rivergate is in crisis. To call this town home, you’ll be
working for desperate nobles, escorting merchant barges, or exploring the
fallen walls of ancient monasteries. Rivergate is the busy hub of mankind,
with all its intrigue and peril.

**Slimshire, High Plains Outpost:** The coming of the ‘White Bird’ and The
Holy Order has grown this town, once a wide spot in the road to Hakburg,
to new heights. Ruling here is Lord Pickins, and times have been good.
Such fortune has attracted the destructive attention of goblins from the
Shadow Glades, Orc raiders from the deep desert, and even the darkly
dreaming infl uence of a mysterious entity generally referred to as ‘the eye
in the well.’ To call this town home, you will be confronting vampiric cults,
fi ghting goblin skirmishers, or working to secure allies in the war with the
Orcs.

Before you choose a hometown, and all the thematic elements that come
with it, let’s get into the rules of play...

## HometownsHometownsHometowns


## Game Flow

It’s one thing to describe towns, dream up adventures, or role play a
heroic character. But this is a _game_ not just a narrative, governed by chance
and rules. When dice are being used to create surprising events, govern
confl ict, or test character ability, you’ll be playing in the following fl ow.

**- Setting the Scene:** When a gathering with friends changes tone from
    chatter to gameplay, the GM will gather attention, set music and lights,
    ensure all players are ready to go, and begin. Through a series of
    descriptions, reminders, questions and confi rmations, a great GM will
    pull everyone back to a specifi c moment, where the story is waiting to
    continue. _“The empire of frogs is at your doorstep, rallying columns_
    _of warriors in the marsh. The Alderman has chosen your company_
    _to defend the southern wall, entrusting you with the safety of the_
    _mysterious old man called Grimblegums. As the war-cry of frog-folk is_
    _heard, drums in the bog, we see our heroes at the ready. Grimblegums_
    _trembles with anticipation for the battle to come. Let’s get into it.”_
**- Phases and Rounds:** Once everyone is in the moment, the action kicks
    in. The great majority of play time happens in _phases_ , moving from
    player to player around the table. The GM will call the next phase,
    and ask what you are doing. Descriptions become dice rolls and their
    hoped-for results. Enemies attack, the scene and terrain may change or
    escalate, and on it goes. A phase is one moment of action, a shared sliver
    of time between heroes and enemies. A round is one full set of phases
    for players and the GM. _“In the fi nal seconds before the explosion, I_
    _bring my blade down on the evil commander! Victory is ours!”_
**- Transitions and Table Talk:** When a scene is concluded, the story will
    lurch forward. There will be GM descriptions, montages, player plans,
    and a short break. Players will be seeking means to rest or upgrade
    their characters. The GM will be revealing new truths, keep the danger
    pressing in, and offer little quarter for weary warriors. When the
    transition is complete, a new scene will be set and it all begins again.
    _“As the smoke of battle clears, a new horror rises in the swamp... it’s_
    _already within a bowshot of the wall! Any actions in phase 1?”_

## Game FlowGame FlowGame Flow


## Making Rolls

Great games always include interesting and varied rolls for players. All
kinds of moments will call for rolling dice in the categories below.

**- Flat Roll:** To test simple, unmodifi ed luck, the GM may call for a ‘fl at’
    roll. This simple roll is made on **_a D20, rolling at or below the target_**
    **_or opposing roll_** to succeed. _“You grab hold of the anchor chain to_
    _pull, but a fi sh-man is pulling from below the waves! Let’s see who can_
    _roll lowest on a D20!”_
**- Player-Declared Skill Roll:** Often during play, you will announce _“I_
    _will roll my jump skill to leap over this creek!”_ or some equivalent.
    Roll D20 at or below that skill’s listed value to succeed. In some
    cases, a diffi culty penalty will reduce the skill’s value. Note that
    many specialized or athletic actions are **_simplynot possible_** without a
    working skill! _“You strain to bend the bars, but without a Muscle skill,_
    _you accomplish nothing!”_
**- Called-For Defense Roll:** Enemies do not make attack rolls! When
    attacked, the GM will ask you to roll Defense. Roll at or below this
    value to avoid injury from the incoming attack. An enemy stat, ATK,
    will act as a penalty to reduce Defense rolls. _“The serpent lashes out at_
    _you! The viper has ATK 3, so roll Defense with a -3 penalty!”_
**- Rolling Damage/Effect:** There is no ‘to-hit’ roll in CROWN and
    SKULL! When you attack, you roll damage instantly! This roll can use
    a wide variety of dice. Add the total rolled for damage infl icted. This
    roll can be reduced by an enemy stat called DEF.
**- Yes/No Rolls:** When important yes/no questions come up, and the GM
    doesn’t have an answer, roll 1D6. 1, 2, 3: NO. 4, 5, 6: YES.
**- All Other Rolls:** How long until the boat arrives? How many
    houndmasters are there? How tall is the statue? How much armor does
    this knight have? All kinds of numbers are needed and rolled for in
    play. Be fl exible, ready for anything, and trust the dice absolutely.

## Making RollsMaking RollsMaking Rolls


## Attrition

Sustaining damage from hazards and attacks is part of any RPG. You’ll
be hit by arrows, knock your head, sustain sword cuts, or drop items when
exhausted. Attrition is a term for the reduction of your character’s resources
when hit by hazards and attacks. Here’s how it works...

### WHEN INJURED, CROSS OFF EQUIPMENT AND/OR SKILLS

**Cross ‘Em Off:** When you’re hurt, you’ll be losing use of your skills and
gear! _Crossed-off_ equipment and skills cannot be used until restored or
repaired. Role play it! Attrition impairs your senses, physical wellness, or
equipment beyond use. In some cases, items may be lost permanently, but
skills are never permanently lost. A few simple rules govern attrition.

**Attrition Types:** Enemies and hazards will hit you in one of 5 ways:

- Basic Attrition: Cross off any 1 equipment or skill
- Flesh Attrition: Randomly select a skill and cross it off
- Equipment Attrition: Randomly select 1 equipment and cross it off
- Destroy Attrition: Destroy 1 random equipment AND cross off 1
    randomly selected skill. Destroyed equipment is permanently lost
- Brutal Attrition: Cross 1D6 total random equipment and skills

**Total Inventory:** All characters are allowed 10 skills and 10 items in their
inventory maximum. All small items are counted as a single ‘pouch’ item.

**Healing and Repair:** Upon a successful heal (by magic, potion, or fi rst
aid), restore 1 crossed-off skill. For damaged equipment, use repair or
armorer skill. Destroyed gear will need to replaced entirely.

**Rest & Recovery:** Regain a combined 1D4 of equipment and skills with a
night’s rest in safety. Additionally, after each scene in play, **once safety is
found and no enemies or timers are incoming** , _‘Take a Breather.’_ Regain
1 equipment or skill... catch your breath, ready to go on.

**Death:** If a hit can’t be absorbed by inventory, you take a ‘hit to the heart’
and will die at the end of the next phase 5 unless healed. Phase? Read on...

## AttritionAttritionAttrition


## PhasesPhasesPhasesPhases

Phases are a unique aspect of CROWN and SKULL. They divide time
into bite-size pieces, and give player turns order, timing, and detail as each
scene unfolds. Enemies also uses phases to act.

**The 5 Phases:** Think of phases as cool moments in an action scene. A
collection of these moments is called a round. Which phase a hero takes
action is a meaningful choice for timing and strategy. There are no ‘held
actions’ here (as in many RPGs), and your phase is locked for the encounter
once chosen, so choose with intent!

**Choosing a Phase:** Generally, players will agree on which phase is best,
especially after a few battles inform their decision. What phase a character
chooses can be changed, but not mid-combat. Players can also choose the
same phase. Track your choice on your character sheet here...

**On Your Phase:** When your phase comes up, it’s your turn to act. You
have three options, listed below.

**- Move:** Move elsewhere in the scene, about 6” table space. A small
    ‘sidestep’ move is allowed without using one’s phase.
**- Perform an Action:** Make an attack, use a skill, cast a spell or perform
    one discreet action. This takes your entire phase.
**- Hurry:** If you need to move AND do something in one turn, your haste
    opens up your Defenses with clumsy haste. All enemies in the scene
    gain +5 ATK against you for 1 round. Hurry can only be used for a
    move+action combo, not dual action or dual move.

**Enemy Phases:** Foes will act in 1-3 phases per round! A monster attacking
in phases 1, 3, and 5, for example, will keep an entire team of heroes
occupied! Any time enemies and heroes share a phase, heroes go fi rst.

**The GM Call:** During play, the GM will keep things cruising along by
‘calling’ for actions during a phase. _“Ok, it’s now phase 3, who’s up? Lucy,
that’s you! The wolves are coming in fast, what will you do?”_


## Hero Points

In the course of their perilous lives, our heroes will need replacement
gear, new armor, healing herbs, new skills, magic elixirs, wagons, war
horses, hired thugs, bribe funds, beach huts and court fi nery to survive and
thrive. CROWN and SKULL uses **hero points** for players to buy items and
upgrade their characters.

You’ll be using hero points to create, and later grow, your character. The
GM will award hero points after each session, granting more for ‘session
mvp’ or other momentous elements of play. In CROWN and SKULL, this
replaces the heaping of treasure. As such, you’ll be looking for a chance
to spend these gathered points on new skills, spells, improved equipment,
or even an animal companion. There is, however, a key limitation to your
spending opportunities:

### HERO POINTS CAN ONLY BE SPENT TO UPGRADE A

### CHARACTER WHEN RESTING IN A SAFE PLACE WITH

### REQUIRED FACILITIES OR SERVICES

At fi rst, this limitation may not seem like much. Resting to regain resources
is very common in many RPGs. Simple restoration occurs by the rules
on page 12. **Spending hero points** is a different matter, requiring rest,
safety, skilled people, special equipment, training, or technical services to
perform. In short, spending hero points is not just rest... it’s an active state
of character development with more specifi c requirements than rest and
safety.

Upgrading or creating new armor may require a forge, anvil, or capable
blacksmith. Improving a falconry skill requires meeting with a local
expert. Upgrading a magic skill might be achieved by reading from age-
old tablets or dusty tomes. This limitation, combined with a life of travel
and danger, should make the spending of hero points a milestone moment
for any character. _“Is that? Can it be? A TOWN? Gods above, let’s go! I’ve
been sitting on a dozen points for ages!”_

## Hero PointsHero PointsHero Points


## The Extremes

During play, things can get intense. Some rolls are all but impossible,
death can be all too close, defeat imminent! At times like these, the extremes
of the game are your only chance, so know them well.

**Negotiation:** Characters often get themselves into terrible situations of
danger and limited time. When this happens, rolls can become prohibitively
diffi cult. This is a time to negotiate with the GM, seeking environmental
or strategic elements that can soften the diffi culty. Don’t be shy! _“The wall
isn’t climbable? Can I lean one of these desks against it for a boost?”_

**Critical Success and Failure:** Extreme successes and failures are called
critical or ‘crits.’ A D20 roll of 1 scores a critical success, and a 20 a critical
failure. Each of these rolls will create a maximal version of success or
failure. Critical successes overcome impossible odds, grant extra time, or
defy belief. Critical failures cost precious equipment, accelerate destructive
environments, or lend advantages to foes. “ _It’s a crit! Not only do you leap
the creek, your pursuer falls in!”_

**Hero Coins:** Acts of heroism or astounding play are rewarded by the GM
with a hero coin. A hero coin (not to be confused with _hero points_ !) can be
redeemed to **1)** Reroll any roll entirely. **2)** Maximize the damage or output
of an attack or effect. Coins can be freely given between players. A player
may only have 1 coin at a time. _“We need this attack to be huge... we’re out
of options! Here, take my coin.”_

**Meta-Gaming:** In an effort to overcome or outwit the odds, players may
fi nd themselves ‘meta-gaming,’ that is, using their overall knowledge
of game mechanics to exploit details or loopholes. This has two forms,
one good, one bad. The good kind of meta-game means players use deep
knowledge of items and mechanics to maximize their chances. The bad
kind (often called ‘cheesing’) employs hard-to-believe or fl imsy methods
to make things easy or gimp the game. Leaping from a rock to earn a _deadly_
attack? Great. Padding your hero with ham sandwiches to absorb attrition?
Not very cool. _“My fi ghter has 10 skills, all at value 3. My inventory is
mainly free biscuits. I also carry a bag of backup biscuits.” “Dude.”_


Once you have a sense for the basic fl ow of the game, it’s time to get
into some nuts and bolts decisions to build a playable character. Grab a
CROWN and SKULL character sheet, or just use your trusty journal to
jot down skills and ideas, or start drawing the ever-important character
portrait! To build your character...

**For Beginners: Templates and Prompts**
To get right into rolling dice with no hassle, choose a hometown then
choose a character template starting on p. 20. This will get you started
playing instantly without learning the point-build system. You can also use
the Character Prompts on p. 22 to get story and background ideas fl owing
for your new character.

**For Experienced Players: Custom Built Characters**
For more fi elded RPG veterans, CROWN and SKULL features a robust, in-
depth point buy creation system. This super-fl exible method lets you create
everything using hero point costs and discounts... even spells, equipment,
and companions. Skip to p. 26 to start your custom character.

**And Beyond: Hero Points**
No matter how you create your character, you’ll gain experience in play
with hero points. These can spent to add skills, spells, or equipment to a
character using the same rules and options custom characters use. You can
save them up or spend as you go. Every 10 hero points earned, you’ll gain
a bonus reward specifi c to your hometown. All the rules you need for this
growth process are right here in the Player’s Guide. Good luck out there,
hero.

## Character Creation

```
When building or expanding a character, always
feel free to make bad decisions. It’s a tough
world out there, not everything we experience
makes us better. Me? I spend every point I can
get on Resist. Better for quaffi n’.
```

Forest adventurer? Your home town is **GARDENBURROW**

In the far west, the elven forest town of Gardenburrow serves as a waypost
for the borders of Thryn. The town itself is on a small rise, with wooden
fortifi cations, and a great central oak tree that serves as the town square.

As stewards of the vast bogs and forests here, the town is always busy
with travelers, horticulturists, druid-kind, game hunters, forest foragers,
and those heading to the dwarven lands of Ullur’s Teeth.

In recent years, a shadow has been spreading through the Oakenwood.
Crops are failing, elder trees are withering away. Frogman defectors,
venturing here from the marshes, believe the problem demands a new
alliance. Can the heroes make friends of the cruel frog-kin and heal the
forest? A council is called in the town longhouse. Something must be done.

**Alderman Wallabytarnwhatwallaby:** The Alderman here is called
Wallaby for short. He is a proudfoot scholar, almost two centuries old, and
a lover of festivals. He relies on good counsel from many townsfolk. Local
envoys and lords are widely known to adore the old fellow, coming from
far and wide to offer gifts on his birthday.

**The Suede & Saddle:** Gardenburrow features a women’s social club
for food, drink, and reprieve. Any female character may stay here free,
gathering information or restocking basic supplies at no charge. The only
male allowed in these walls is a bumbling cook named Scooby.

**Selene:** An elder hunter and forest warden, Selene is widely known as
the oldest elf in this region. She was making camp here before there was
a town at all, and knows every nook and cranny of the Oakenwood and
beyond. She is a descendent of the third royal line of Thryn, enjoying
all the privileges of a Baroness but choosing a humble life. Selene will
only become available to players for high-level or high-stakes endeavors,
focusing her skills on saving the world, defeating titans, or undoing sinister
schemes beyond Gardenburrow’s borders.

Mountains and mischief? Your hometown is **RIVERGATE**

Wealthy families have called this port city home for generations. The
lucrative gem trade has earned Rivergate its fortune, so alliances with the
Stormkeeper dwarves are ever-strong. Recent conscriptions of dwarves to
Runnminir have diminished earnings from the mines greatly, earning the
ire of the Walcrests and other ruling families here.

In recent days, adventurers have found abundant work scouting and serving
as messengers for various groups moving to fi ll the vacuum in the mining
trade.

Against this busy backdrop, a new threat has made the roads deadly, even
by day. Mysterious archers have been harassing travelers and residents
alike, leaving none alive to identify them. A murmur of fear is spreading...

**Lady Walcrest:** The most widely respected fi gure in Rivergate is a venerable
Baroness: heir to the Walcrest empire, Lady Ezmerelda Walcrest. Well into
her 70s, she has seen and survived it all, but held true to the old alliances
and standards of the town. All city policy is approved and executed by her
and her council of advisors.

**The Frothy Mare:** One of the most famous (or infamous) taverns in the
realm calls Rivergate home: The Frothy Mare. This chaotic, multi-level
inn, eatery and house of revelry serves as a meeting point for all kinds of
river folk, known for its cheese-sausages and dwarven ale by the gallon.
The lead barkeep is a red-mustached stout fellow called Barmm.

**Thenneport Docks:** The complex of piers, moorings and cranes in
Rivergate is a wonder of The North Holds. All manner of barges, fi shing
boats and rivercraft gather here to load and unload cargo, conscript crew,
and arrange expeditions to every corner of the world. So much wealth
moves through these ports, there is an abundance of ‘red cloak’ guards
present at all times. These city soldiers sport 10-foot spears, and they are
some of the fi nest fi ghters in The Holds.

Dangerous deserts? Your hometown is **SLIMSHIRE**

This remote town was once a mere wide spot in the road to Hakburg. Since
the arrival of its unlikely benefactor, Lord Pickins, after the Bloodwing
War, the town has seen a veritable golden age. This has been bolstered by
a rock solid relationship with the ever-growing Holy Order.

As Slimshire has reached the apogee of its prosperity though, a dark force
has emboldened goblins from the Shadow Glades and orc raiders from the
remnants of Dalric’s Wall. To make things worse, Lord Pickins has been
seen less and less of late, cloistered with his ailing daughter Kay, who,
according to rumor, has been affl icted with a vampiric sickness.

A new alliance with the folk of Cloudtop has made adventuring a lucrative
trade, even calling up Proudfoot riders from the frontier of Hakburg.

**Dunsel & the Kid:** Operating from a blacksmith-and-mercantile in town
called ‘Haldur’s Goods,’ Dunsel is a stout folk merchant, beer expert,
and journeyman smith. His ever-present sidekick is a fearless boy known
simply as The Kid. These two have their ear to most of the goings-on in
town, and the growing military challenges at hand.

**The Bee Spoke:** The oldest tavern in town was recently damaged by a
collapse and fi re during an orc incursion. Its owner, Bespo Kerat, was killed
in the blaze. Now his daughter Revelle has disappeared. The calamity of
the Bee Spoke has rallied folk to fi ght back against the orcs, no matter what
the cost. So, reconstruction has begun.

**The Eye in the Well:** As Slimshire faces the challenges of a full-fl edged
city, darkness has entered the dreams of its people. The dream is always
the same: descending into a pit of wet stone, beyond the lightless water,
deeper, darker, until a single yellowish eye opens in the murk. The dread of
this dream-intrusion is slowly growing in Slimshire, but its nature, origin,
and solution are completely unknown. Some doomsayers claim the goblin-
orc alliance and the eye are somehow connected...

In traversing the frontiers of life, each of us have a few trusted things,
garments or possessions we trust beyond all others.

```
EQUIPPED WITH...
```
**1. Axes and Hammers:** You prefer the heft and balance of ‘headed’
    weapons, and the crushing, chopping fi ghting style there found.
**2. Armor from Head to Toe:** With a skilled fi t, perfectly comfortable.
**3. A Single, Huge Weapon:** You have eschewed versatility in favor of
    specialization. You and your weapon are one. A focused fi ghter.

    manner of implements and handy doo-dads.
**5. Mining Gear:** A simple kit for the pragmatic delver.

    trinkets, curios, wands, and jewelry.

    reach, piercing, and versatility of a 10-foot spear, halberd, or bill hook.

    trust... swords, magic, beasts? No. But these? These you can trust.
**13. Lightweight Cloak and Quiet Boots:** Soft materials for stealth.
**14. Chainmail and Emblazoned Tabard:** The armor kit of a soldier.
**15. A Many-Pocketed Great-Cloak:** Your odd interests make this critical.
**16. Armor from the Marsh Lands:** You possess a suit of protective gear
    from the frog empire: slat plates, leather ties, ‘gunomo’ undercoat.
**17. A Bold-Crested Helm:** Walk tall with a high-topped steel helmet,
    horsehair crest, top spike, or bannered brim.
**18. Charms and Holy Symbols:** You carry a collection of beads, vestments,
    and blessed objects that invoke feelings of divinity.
**19. Flintlock Guns and Kit:** Black powder weapons are your specialty.
**20. Froggish Weapons:** The curved blades, fl exible steel, red-lacquer hafts
    and brass guards of frog-folk blades are your preferred equipment.


Adventurers are a different breed. At some point in your life, you stepped

**9. The Crops Failed:** I was chosen to fi nd the evil cause of the blight.
**10. The Alderman Came:** Our town headman chose a handful of us for

    those moldering walls changed us... posing too many questions.
**12. We Went Searching for Better Fishing:** Our feet just took us too far!
**13. The Rats Came Ashore:** In the chaos, folk running about, I was tossed

CROWN and SKULL really shines most when using the custom creation
system below. Hero points are used to ‘buy’ every detail. In the following
pages you’ll fi nd everything you need to build a fully custom character. If
you have an idea that isn’t listed, just work with your GM to add new bits.

**STEP 1: Starting Points:** All characters start with **50 hero points** to spend
on their build. You’ll be keeping track of your running point total as you
work, so don’t be shy with making a mess on the page.

**STEP 2: Choose Flaw(s):** Visualize your new character. What is a weakness
or stress point for them? Flaws imply history and drive believable role
play. Take a maximum 2 at creation, and maximum 4 in the character’s
lifetime. Each fl aw adds 5 points to your point total. Flaws are entirely
optional! Track your new total and move ahead.

**STEP 3: Core Ability:** Choose a core ability and deduct 15 points for
its acquisition. This is one of the most useful mechanical aspects of your
character, and you can only ever choose one, so choose wisely! You can
also choose NONE here and save the 15 points for other ideas.

**STEP 4: Choose Skills:** Skills are the majority of rolls you’ll be making
in play. Just roll a D20, at or below the skill value to succeed. Sometimes,
the GM may place a penalty on this roll, so high skills are a welcome
friend! Outfi t your character with a handful of skills that fi t your concept.
Skills are purchased at 1-to-1 point value, meaning a skill of 6 would cost
6 points and so on. No skill can be higher than 18 or lower than 3. 10 skills
max in inventory.

Complete your custom character with the steps below. Creating
customized spells and equipment is a learned skill as a player, so don’t be
surprised if it takes some time and attention. This is where the hero point
system truly shines with a little ingenuity and a clear character concept to
guide your decisions.

**STEP 5: Buy & Customize Equipment:** Visualize your character and
spend your precious points on the equipment you need to satisfy the
concept. There will plenty of time in play to earn hero points and buy
more equipment, so focus on essentials. Record damage and details for
any weapons equipped. If creating a very specifi c idea, like a priest with a
talking sword, dive into the custom equipment rules and be creative! Add
the total value of armor equipped and record it as your Defense. You’ll **_roll
a D20 at or under that value_** when attacked. Keep track of fi nal costs and
move ahead. 10 items max in equipment inventory.

**STEP 6: Buy, Customize, or Scratch-Build Spells:** Of all the steps in
custom character creation, none is more nuanced and ‘DIY’ than creating
spells. This takes a fl air for magic creativity, a good handle of effects and
limitations, and your GM to make a few calls on the magic you’re creating.
All this odd work will be especially satisfying to the dedicated wizard-
player. For even more options, see The Path of Magic.

**STEP 7: Acquire & Customize a Companion:** If your character concept
includes a small familiar, falcon, pet or mount, use these rules and pay the
points needed.

**STEP 8: Choose Your Lineage:** There are fi ve lineages to choose from,.
Each offers a bit of fl avor for your place in the world.

**Finish:** Clean up left over points (is there such a thing?) or reduce skill
values to make ends meet. If you like, you can even save a handful of hero
points for spending after a session or two. The possibilities with this style
of character creation are limitless... they just take some hobby-brain, pen
and paper, and the ever-important character concept. You got this!

***All characters have a base 6 Defense for clothing***
```

## Armor and Defense

Defense is a crucial aspect of your CROWN and SKULL character. Any
time enemies attack, they make no roll... it’s up to you to roll Defense!

```
All characters receive Defense 6 at no cost... basic clothes. Add
additional armor values to determine total Defense value. Damaged
or destroyed armor no longer contributes to this value. Max 18.
```
**Using Backup Armor:** When loading up on armor, duplicates can be
carried, but only one of a type/body location can be _worn_ to boost Defense.
You can’t wear two helmets, for example. That said, backups can be carried
in your 10 item slots, but only _one of a type/body location counts toward
your Defense_. Backup armor is just as vulnerable to attrition as worn armor
or any other equipment. This gives ‘tank’ heroes many vectors of strategy.

**Damaged/Destroyed:** When hit by an enemy, you can ‘cross off’ a piece of
armor as your attrition. Most commonly, this means the armor is damaged
beyond use. Some foes with corrosive or ‘sundering’ attacks will **destroy**
armor, not just damage it. Delete the item from your inventory permanently.

**The Armorer Skill:** All heavy armor fi ghters worth their weight are trained
in the repair of armor. This skill allows an armor user to ‘self-heal’ with a
successful skill roll. Fall back, strap down a dented bracer, charge!

**Precious Space:** With the tightly limited inventory of your character,
you’ll fi nd that there is often little room for armor, forcing the kinds of
tough choices that make teamwork essential.

```
Aye, I carry three shields most days, and a canoe
paddle for good measure. I fi nd that schlepping
the damn things is better than fi ghting back a
pack of ice wolves with a pair of mittens and
harsh language, but that’s just me.

Gear is king for the life of an adventurer! It’s cheap, lying around, and
often quite awesome in creative hands. In CROWN and SKULL, hero
points can be used to acquire and upgrade equipment. Like all point-
spending in the game, this can only be done while resting in a safe place
with the aid of an expert... in this case, a smith, mentor, or artifi cer.

Gear is like most things in CROWN and SKULL: it has a base cost, gets
more expensive with effects, and earns a discount with limitations. This
allows you to buy a super simple dagger, or craft a very specifi c magic item
all with the same value system. Any given effect added to gear can only
be applied ONCE PER ITEM, though an item may have multiple effects.

**1 Point Gear** (D6 weapons, +1 armors):
Small weapons, pouches, rope, lantern, torch, climbing kit, travel rations,
staff, ring or jewelry item, cloak, boots.

**2 Point Gear** (D8 weapons, +2 armors):
Medium-sized weapons, light armor, fl ares, bear traps & snares, thieves’
tools, common supplies.

**3 Point Gear** (D10 weapons, +3 armors):
Heavy and exotic weapons, mechanized weapons and tools, gear for
horses, complex or heavy armor.

**5 Point Gear** (D12 weapons, +4 armors):
Firearms, siege weapons, war-ready equipment and armor.

## Custom Equipment

```
Keep it simple, laddy. Pay an extra 3 points to
make that sword deadly. Even this simple level
of gear customization can give ye an edge in
battle. Me? I prefer all my armor be cold iron
forged... only way to be sure!

## Character Creation: Spells

If you’re playing a magic-user in CROWN and SKULL, you have a
wealth of possibilities ahead. You can choose from basic spells, let your
GM offer available spells to buy with points as you progress, or _create_ your
spells custom for the unmatched fun of bespoke magical effects. Whether
you use premade spells, build them custom, or discover them as equipment
in the form of wands, staves, rings or scrolls, all spells follow a few core
rules in CROWN and SKULL.

```
CRITICAL CONCEPTS FOR ALL SPELLS
```
**Casts and Expend** : Spells are cast on command. By default, spells include
1 cast. Once a spell has no casts remaining, it is expended and must be
studied again in rest and safety to cast again. Add casts with customization.

**Magic Skill:** The Magic skill is rolled to contain Infernal and Unstable
spells, or utilize the Wizard Savant ability. It is also used as a defensive
measure against enemy spells and effects in some cases.

**Somatics:** By default, all spells require audible words and gestures with
both hands to cast. This must be remembered when casting under duress,
when using equipment, or when speech is suppressed or disrupted.

**Duration:** The default duration of a spell’s effect is 1D6 phases. If an
effect is to conclude on the caster’s action phase, it dissipates at the _end_ of
that phase. Upgrade effect duration with customization.

**Effect:** The default effect output of a spell is 1D6. This could be damage,
for example. This amount can be upgraded with customization.

**Range:** All spells require touch as the default range to cast. This can be
upgraded to ‘ranged’ or ‘area’ with customization.

**Targets:** In their default state, all spells affect a single target. A spell can be
upgraded to affect multiple targets or areas with customization.

```

## Character Creation: Custom Spells

Creating and modifying spells is an art in itself, and may take some
practice. Much like the wizards of old, you’ll be scheming how limitations
and effects can counterbalance one another, or how a simple upgrade could
make a Basic Spell all it needs to be. Settle in to the ancient library, and
ponder the mysteries of Custom Spells...

The simplest way to begin your wizard’s journey is to customize Basic
Spells. Once you have some hero points to spend, consider these options:

- Spend 3 points for each new effect to be added
- Add limitations, reducing spell cost by 3 for each, 1 pt minimum cost
- You must be in a safe place to customize spells
- No single effect can be stacked more than 3 times total

When Basic Spells will no longer fulfi ll the desired level of magical craft,
you are ready to create spells from scratch. This assumes you have a solid
working knowledge of spell-casting in general, with specifi c outcomes in
mind. Here’s all you need to know:

- Give the new spell an evocative name that implies its function
- Select one effect as focal or use a Basic Spell as a starting point. Stack
    on effects as desired, tracking cost as you go. Each effect raises the
    spell cost by 3. No single effect can be stacked more than 3 times total
- Add limitations to the spell to get its cost down as needed. Each
    limitation reduces spell cost by 3. Cost can never be less than 1 point
- You must be in a safe place for 1 day or more to create new spells
- Check in with your GM to get the fi nal approval on your new spell

Wizards have many ways of studying their craft. As an introduction to spell
creation, consider visualizing a well-known spell from your role playing
past...

Blasts of fi re, for example, are a staple for all adventurer-mages. Use the
spell creation rules to create such a well-known spell, getting a feel for
effect and limitation combinations. Don’t see what you have in mind?
Work with your GM to add effects or limitations as needed.

## Character Creation: Acquiring Spells

Magic has a wild, boundless nature that can permeate every aspect of a
game and its setting. Before things get out of control, your GM may want to
place some limitations on how and where magic can be researched, created,
stored, or modifi ed. These aren’t hard rules, but thematic limits that invite
our heroes to seek out magical powers rather than simply, inexplicably,
acquiring them with hero points at any time.

```
ACQUIRING NEW SPELLS
```
**Safety:** Decoding, translating, modifying, creating or learning spells can
only be accomplished with concentration and focus. This means a safe
place and restful conditions. In ‘the fi eld’ these conditions can be hard to
fi nd. Safety means no threats of any kind are incoming.

**Elder Wizards:** It takes decades to learn higher magics. Elder wizards are
a good way to access new or more powerful spells. If more than 20 points
have been / are being put into a spell (before limitations applied), the GM
may require an elder wizard to aid your work. Your campaign may even
have GM-made spells that can only be acquired from such a mentor. How
to fi nd such a wizard? Who knows?

**Spell Storage:** Gems, scrolls, rings, amulets, wands, staves, and frescoes
are the common residences of spells. All of these require some acumen to
translate and comprehend. Wizards are often searching for such ‘containers’
wherever they go. A _Detect Object_ spell built to fi nd magic or spell storage
is handy for such work. Given time and safety, the spell(s) therein could be
learned, no longer requiring the container.

**Gaia Theory:** The land itself holds magical power. In very special places
in the wilderness, new magic can be acquired directly from this vast,
mysterious source of power. These are most commonly a henge or heroic
grave site. To grasp the hidden power of such a place, the aspirant must
spend a matter of hours or days there, searching for subtle energies and
cues from nature itself. Numerous intellectual skills can be handy in this
endeavor.

When building or considering magic and spell casting for your character,
the question of ‘Why doesn’t everyone make a spellcaster?’ may come up.
Spells can be very powerful, transcend the abilities of sword and shield, or
simply seem more exciting in play. The wizard player is invited to consider
some aspects of The North Holds when musing on this subject...

**Hatred of Magic:** Some remote communities, religious sects, or
superstitious governments have no love of the magic-user. You may be
hunted, despised, imprisoned, mocked, robbed or plotted against if your
use of the arcane arts is revealed. Also, many lower forms of monstrous
life such as fi sh folk, ogres, reptiles and wild beasts can have a violent
and sudden aggression when magic is used, targeting the caster before all
others.

**Unwanted Attention:** Loud noises, pyroclastic displays, bizarre robes,
twisted staves and the like are seen, by many, as a portent of bad things.
Wizards are strange, far-minded folk. This can make stealth and deception
more challenging, or create ill-favored rumors.

**Vulnerability Without Magic:** By investing their hero points in spells,
magic-users become intrinsically vulnerable if they should enter a magic-
nullifying or silenced environment, be stripped of magic items, lose the
Magic skill to attrition, or have their hands bound. This vulnerability seems
unlikely to the greenhorn adventurer, but all veterans know how real these
threats are.

**Complexity of Play:** On a more ‘meta-game’ level, there is a burden of
complexity in effi ciently playing a wizard or magic-user. Spells must be
clearly tracked; thought must be given BEFORE one’s turn as to actions
taken; times, outputs and other specifi cations must be clear to the whole
table, without eating up undue time. All these duties can be overly clerical
for some players, or become so cumbersome that other players are groaning
and falling asleep during the wizard’s ponderous turns.

If none of these sway you, then may the arcane be with you... always.

It’s dangerous to go alone! On the dark adventures ahead, you may
have need of a falcon, a hunting dog, or even a paid retainer or scribe. In
CROWN and SKULL these are called companions. You can customize a
companion much like a spell or piece of prized equipment.

With a clear concept of your companion in mind, get a heap of points ready
to spend, and use the rules below.

The most important thing to remember with companions is that they will
not serve to double your actions in combat. A companion action counts
as your own. You operate as one! This keeps companion characters from
overtaking the table.

**3-Point Companion** (Small animals)
A ferret, rat, snake, parrot, frog, or hedgehog may not have great strength,
but they make good company, stow away with ease and generally go
unnoticed by foes.
D4 attacks, 1 skill value 9, 6 Defense

**5-Point Companion** (Medium sized beasts or simple devices)
Dogs, cats, falcons, owls, or even small pigs count as medium-sized. Also
in this group are tiny devices such as mechanical animals, orbs or smaller
automatons. The latter should be very rare in any campaign. Medium
companions have more combat capability, but also become targets.
D6 attacks, 2 skills value 9, 9 Defense

**12-Point Companion** (Large animals or retainers)
A tiger, wolf, bear, or condor is considered the largest of companions. Also
in this group are trainee human fi ghters, equipment squires, chroniclers or
personal chefs. The GM should be prepared to manage the mechanics and
story for such a companion, without allowing them to consume more table
time than any other character type.
D8 attacks, 3 skills value 9, 9 Defense

## Character Creation: Lineage

Choose a LINEAGE when creating a character. Lineage does not include
mechanical aspects, as each population is vast and diverse.

**Humankind are a versatile folk...**

The story of human folk and their kin in The North Holds is a ragged line
of ambition, ascension, and ruin. Again and again have their kings and
golden ages fallen to calamity. This is largely attributed to their unusual
desire to unite The Holds under one banner, as the Earl did so many years
ago.

Ironically, in present times human folk are less unifi ed than ever. Their
royal lines and heritage are largely lost. For some, this is just politics and
daydreaming, but for others it is a call to fi nd and lift a true king or queen,
and reclaim the great vision of the past. How this can be done, which
bloodline has the purest claim, and all the intrigue that goes with such
questions, is argued in every lord’s hall.

**Elven folk have a knack for the magical...**

Elves in The North Holds have long endeavored to stay out of wars and
witchcraft, instead choosing to cultivate powerful allies with nature and
primal forces. As the sole keepers of Dragon Tooth, they wield this power
with care and patience... most of the time. Exactly what to do with the
delicate friendship of dragonkin is a matter of perpetual debate among
elven scholars and wizards.

Within the elven people, there is yet disunity despite the high-fl ying
banners and pageantry of King’s Field. Some claim that King Ithamel of
Forestheart is a deceiver... a demon. Others impugn the law of Thryn as
appeasement to lesser houses, demanding the elves deal elemental justice
to all The Holds.

As self-proclaimed keepers of these weighty matters, elves curate the
greatest libraries and scriptoriums in the realm... a tool they will surely
need in the days to come.

**Stout Folk are usually built like tanks...**

Ah, the beard-sporting, ale-quaffi ng, hammer-wielding folk of Runnminir
and Ullur! Stout folk, also called dwarves by the ill-mannered, can all trace
their family lines to one of these two ancestral homes, endlessly arguing
theirs as the best. Stout folk have a hearty sense of moral duty. They carry
an inheritance of mighty deeds from their ancestors, allying with all the
folk of The Holds to preserve the best things in life.

The only weak point in the stout folk code of honor is the sinister shadow
of greed. Players creating stout folk characters should remain ever-mindful
of dwarven greed and its effects.

**Proudfoots are feastwise inventors...**

These diminutive folk are a happy and peaceful lot, mostly hailing from
the deserts near Hakburg. They are master horsemen and frontiersfolk...
sturdy, optimistic, and resourceful. Above all they prize a good meal.

By the ingenuity of Proudfoot artisans, the frightening wonder of gunpowder
has come to The Holds in recent years... not simply in pot-bombs or mining
charges, but fl intlock muskets with die-cast bullets. With great care and
caution they guard this deadly new technology.

**Frog-kin are honor-bound, trapped in a violent empire...**

Lord Croakokame is the cruel emperor of all frog-folk, willing to burn
the world to see it under his rule. A strict code of honor keeps his legions
in line, but a very few among them throw down their vows and leave the
murderous empire for greener lands. For this, they are hunted.

Players selecting frog-kin should keep a sharp eye for assassins, will be
considered traitors, and are largely misunderstood by most folk. On the
other hand, froggish warriors are disciplined, skilled absolutists who are
not to be trifl ed with. A weighty lineage indeed.

## Character Creation: Lineage

**Stout Folk are usually built like tanks...**

Ah, the beard-sporting, ale-quaffi ng, hammer-wielding folk of Runnminir
and Ullur! Stout folk, also called dwarves by the ill-mannered, can all trace
their family lines to one of these two ancestral homes, endlessly arguing
theirs as the best. Stout folk have a hearty sense of moral duty. They carry
an inheritance of mighty deeds from their ancestors, allying with all the
folk of The Holds to preserve the best things in life.

The only weak point in the stout folk code of honor is the sinister shadow
of greed. Players creating stout folk characters should remain ever-mindful
of dwarven greed and its effects.

**Proudfoots are feastwise inventors...**

These diminutive folk are a happy and peaceful lot, mostly hailing from
the deserts near Hakburg. They are master horsemen and frontiersfolk...
sturdy, optimistic, and resourceful. Above all they prize a good meal.

## Character Creation: Discovery

With all these tools, prompts and options available to you for creating
a character, there’s one last origin method to consider: _discovery_. This
method places your character in a vulnerable state of amnesia with little
to no equipment. This method can be exciting for newcomers and veterans
alike, but asks a bit of lifting by both player and GM.

**The Opener:** If your group is using discovery-style character creation,
much of who your character will be relies on the nature, details, and themes
of the opening moments. These can be summarized in three parts...

_- Location:_ Where does the story begin, and why is it cool? A remote
    cavern? A dismal tomb? A sinking ship? Choose something everyone
    is excited about.
_- Condition:_ What condition are our heroes in? Asleep too long?
    Imprisoned? Freezing cold? Materialized by magic? Buried alive? This
    is no meet-up in a tavern.
_- Time Pressure:_ What is about to happen, or pushing our heroes to
    action? Something needs to initiate the action, and soon... 1D4 rounds
    soon. The chamber fi lls with water, a blizzard breaks windows, walls of
    fi re close in, air runs out or a giant grinder-machine grows ever closer.

**One Little Memory:** As heroes seek to escape or get moving, a fl eeting
shadow, refl ection, or strange feeling triggers one small memory for each
character. This memory takes the form of a single skill, granted at value 6.

**Stuff Lying Around:** On their way to whatever lies ahead, characters fi nd
1D4 useful items in their immediate area. A rusty iron spear? A ragged
leather vest? A snow-crusted blanket? This is all they have for now.

**I Remember My Name:** After a few exciting moments, rolls, or events,
the GM will notice key details and announce, _“At that moment, shaking the
panic of it all free, gaining a bit of your wits, you remember a name... your
name.”_ Record this name when so instructed. Soon enough, the group will
know itself a little better, and the discoveries are ready to begin. _“Free of
the ice cave, it collapses behind you with only seconds to spare. Beyond,
the vast ice fi elds await, and daylight fades fast...”_

Discovery asks that players lean in to skill sets and ideas as they
unfold during play, while GMs stay highly aware of these cues to reward
memories. It can feel a bit open-ended at fi rst, but trust the adventure, and
each other. There are no hero points in these fi rst few discovery sessions,
just collaborative revelation of our heroes’ identities.

**Finding Memories:** As the early struggles of the fi rst session unfold, both
GM and player should be keenly aware of exciting moments, unlikely
successes, clutch dice rolls, bumps on the head, nostalgic items, or other
triggers for unlocking hero memory. When such a moment occurs, the GM
will announce that another memory has surfaced, spreading them evenly
between heroes. This could be an increase to a skill, a new skill, a piece
of character background, or even a fl aw. Expect 3-5 of these memories per
character in session 1.

**Finding Gear:** Players will be gear-hungry to say the least. Remember
that in CROWN and SKULL ‘usable’ or ‘useful’ inventory is somewhat
rare, even if the world has objects lying about. Expect each character to
fi nd 1-3 useful inventory in session 1.

**Finding Your Past:** Skills and equipment are useful, but to know _who you
are_ is the real pay dirt of a discovery session. This may not even occur in
session 1, but all characters are encouraged to seek their history.

**Origin Revealed:** In the next few sessions, when a character reaches a
moment of truly epic success, poignant role play, or powerful luck, the
GM may announce _“At that moment, you remember everything...”_ Once
this occurs, memories come fl ooding back. The next time the revealed
character is in rest and safety, gain these rewards:

- 2 skills, each at value 9 _“I was a blacksmith... yes! And a good one!”_
- 10 points of basic equipment _“This cache was left for you, sir.”_
- A Core Ability _“The hands are starting to remember...”_
- Memory of how you got into all this _“We must fi nd Castigere!”_

Play then continues as normal, with heroes earning points in play.

## Deeds

When our heroes have done more than survive, more than gain wealth
and equipment and infl uence, but instead have risked their lives for the
good of all and emerged victorious... when these moments occur, the realm
acknowledges a mighty deed. Deeds provide 3 benefi ts to players...

**Hero Points:** When a deed is done, each character receives 3 hero points.
These can be spent (if in a safe place) or saved for later. A deed should be
awarded every other session or so. Listed here are the primary moments
deeds are awarded by the GM...

- Completing a session with fl air. _“You guys, that was amazing. Consider_
    _a mighty deed done! Take 3 hero points, all of ya.”_
- Executing legendary or pivotal actions in play. _“That critical didn’t_
    _just collapse the cavern, it sealed the horrors behind a wall of rock for_
    _all time? Ha! Consider that a mighty deed!”_
- Returning to goodly folk who cheer for their courage and aid.
    _“Wallabytarnwhatwallaby sheds a single tear as you return to town._
    _Children run to meet you, and banners stream in the air. The deed is_
    _done! Victory at last!”_

**Closure:** Normally, the dangerous situations facing ordinary folk get
worse and worse until our heroes come to help. Once a deed is done for
such people, the decay of circumstances fi nally halts. This lets players
move on to other exploits with no worries or loose ends. _“With the goblins
vanquished, and the caverns destroyed, Gardenburrow will never be
threatened again!”_

**Renown:** When word spreads of the heroes’ mighty accomplishments,
bards and poets will begin to assign them titles and nicknames...

```
Ah, the sound of cheering townsfolk and laughing
goats! I may have gone soft in my golden years,
but there’s no better feelin’ in life than to return
to folk made safe, have an ice cold bath, and
drink until the sun rises anew. To the crown!
```

```

Renown is the inevitable result of heroic action, acknowledged by folk of
the realm and GM alike as deeds. When these pile up, the honor of title is
bestowed on our band of adventurers. Here are a few guidelines...

**3 Deeds:** After a few exploits, a hero or group receives a title derived
from a famous doing. Examples of this could be ‘spider-slayer,’ ‘boulder
breaker,’ or ‘the wild man of Mooncrest.’ Stories have begun to circulate
about deeds done, but most folk wouldn’t recognize the heroes if they saw
them. You are little more than a rumor or tavern tall tale.

**5 Deeds:** After so many doings, our heroes acquire actual titles either
individually or as group. ‘Knight Errant,’ ‘Commander,’ ‘Warmaster,’ or
‘Forest Mother’ come to mind. Folk recognize our heroes more often, and
refer them by proper title to show respect. Vendor prices drop, ales are
bought aplenty by admirers and well-wishers.

**10 Deeds:** Here the greatest heroes fi nd their place in history. If awarding
deeds every other session or so, this would be 20 sessions of play. For some
groups, that’s an entire year of campaigning! At this stage, our heroes’
renown is legend. They become part of the ‘world lore’ of The North Holds.
They are offered a fortress, village, or outpost by lord and lady. Some folk
even kneel or swear fealty to such heroes. Titles for renown of this level
could be ‘Lord,’ ‘Baron,’ ‘Duchess,’ ‘Arch Druid,’ or ‘High Priest.’

At this level of play, our protagonists will be ready to take on the largest
perils of the day: plan with kings and generals to end wars, slay titanic
monsters, protect the ascension of royalty, stand for the Crown or the Skull,
explore other dimensions, prevent cosmic calamities, or rescue entire
towns from destruction.

Often, somewhere beyond this level, characters are retired and treated as
mighty avatars of The Holds, fading into the background for a new group
of up-and-coming characters our players create _in their own wake._ This is
when things become truly interesting...

## The Crown or the Skull?

After several perilous chapters, a character earning **25 or more hero points**
in play (not at creation) will earn the attention of mighty forces. This hero
is ready to make the ultimate choice: the CROWN or the SKULL? Once
this threshold has been crossed, the GM will fi nd an opportune moment to
pose this question as part of the ongoing story. The deliverer of this choice
will be a familiar lord, king, mentor, or trusted ally. Larger forces are at
work, and a call to greater duties arrives at last.

_“You stand before me a hero of the realm. Your deeds have not gone
unnoticed. No longer can you chase whims or petty treasures. Yours is a
mighty calling, adventurer. Make your choice!”_ With that, the king opens
his hand, revealing two silver rings. One is carved with a seven-eyed skull,
the other, a high-tined crown. He waits patiently. All eyes are on you.

Since the fall of the world’s unity three decades ago, many heroes have
faced this choice. It has become tradition... a sacrament to lend order to
a chaotic world. The CROWN is not simply ‘the good guys’ nor is the
SKULL wanton evil. The question is a matter of alignment with larger
forces at work in The North Holds.

For players, your job is to announce when 25 hero points have been earned.
For the GM, you are charged with weaving this choice into the campaign
naturally. Before we look at what’s at stake, here are a few pointers.

**Sacred Rite:** When presenting this moment in play, GMs, be sure to pause
the story a bit, revel in this moment. Heralds take the knee, trumpets sound.

**The Ring Itself:** For added effect, offer two actual rings to the player(s)
about to choose. Spare no bravado in their presentation.

**Consider the Group:** Some groups may prefer to all reach the 25 point
threshold together, some independently. Survey their preference.

**The Only Chance:** This choice is only offered once. If a hero refuses to
choose, they will be scorned widely, possibly deemed an enemy to all.

## Heroes of the Realm

Player characters, even in their fl edgling days, have heard inspiring stories
of these mighty folk. Once characters have completed a few adventures,
they will likely hear from one of these famous people. Each is listed below
with an introductory quest.

**Saint Castigere Villaroyas Antares**

_- Location:_ Bramford Abbey area
_- Widely Known:_ For over 400 years, Castigere has dwelled in the veil
    between life and death, lingering in the mortal realm to fulfi ll a vow to
    honor the dead. He is the saint of the grave, the giver of alms to the lost,
    the guide from life to death’s reprieve.
_- Quest:_ The Dead of Stormfoot Woods: Castigere appears as an
    apparition, hovering a few feet above the ground. He asks that heroes
    investigate a legion of wandering skeletons in the forest southwest of
    Jay’s Rock. _‘I fear some evil has risen these souls from their duly-_
    _earned sleep. Please, help me root out this doom!’_

**Greentooth**

_- Location:_ The Bleeding Tree near Blood Manor
_- Widely Known:_ Greentooth is the older sister of Bloodwing the
    Destroyer. She is, perhaps, the oldest being in The Holds. She takes the
    form of a colossal green dragon and a withered old woman. Her hut is
    seen now and then in the deepest of forests... a bubbling stew cooking.
    She is kind and watchful, but ethereal... having lived and died many
    lifetimes. Thus, she seeks allies to aid her causes.
_- Quest:_ The Blood of Kellos: After a recurring dream of Greentooth
    soaring over the Stormkeepers, heroes are mysteriously drawn to the
    old woman’s hut near the Bleeding Tree. She explains that deep below
    the forest, an ancient evil is growing, poisoning the roots of the old oak
    with congealed blood-ichor. Taking dragon form, she offers to shuttle
    the heroes to a remote crag of solid bedrock in the hills south of the
    tree, where a great fi ssure has opened a path into the cavernous realm
    below. _‘Down and through and under the stones, seek the eye of Kellos_
    _and all his blood-soaked bones, to root out the poison and heal the_
    _tree... go in the darkness to fi nally see.’_

    throughout the realm, Raka is blamed by most folk. By order of a local
    lord, our heroes are sent to fi nd him where last sighted: The Wolf Lands.
    Is Raka part of the plague of fl ames, or the solution? _‘Yes, I am Raka._
    _Fire is a living thing, friends. Let’s go hunting.’_

    This quest is no simple thing. Pickins offers a few clues: the research of
    Fairfi eld Abbey nuns, the blood-drinking entity hiding below Slimshire,

    _all this... a way to help her! Time is running my friends, I beg of you.’_

## The Path of Magic

**Zipler’s Ghost**

_- Location:_ Ruinmoor
_- Widely Known:_ Zipler was a warrior bard beloved by all The Holds
    in his day, during the breaking of the Bloodwing War. By strange fate
    he came to wield Ruin, the starfallen sword of legend. When affl icted
    by the vampiric curse, he hid Ruin and let himself be destroyed in
    the plane of fi re... fi nally free of the urge to kill for food. Now, rumor
    spreads that Ruin has been found by the prophet Threya, and Zipler’s
    ghost has risen with dire warnings.
_- Quest:_ The Starfallen Sword: Encountering or seeking out Zipler’s
    phantom, our heroes will be asked to help with the retrieval of the
    deadly weapon, that it may be safeguarded once more. Zipler is barely
    visible, weak with departure from the land of the living, but desperate to
    see Ruin stashed away. His only clue? A woman named Threya carries
    the blade... lurking somewhere in the endless crumble and corridors
    of Ruinmoor tower. _‘That blade is not of this world, and has no place_
    _here... it must be found.’_

**High Princess Kaylia Enzerill, Keeper of Dragon Tooth**

_- Location:_ Thryn / Dragon Tooth
_- Widely Known:_ The Princess is known far and wide, especially for
    renowned appearances at the King’s Field tournaments. She is a
    competent warrior, but more so a scholar of dragonkind. She is the heir
    of Thryn, but chooses a life of adventure, to the chagrin of the High
    King of elves.
_- Quest:_ The Brood of Hydranax: Awarding our heroes a royal
    commendation for their recent efforts, the Princess takes them aside,
    asking if they could serve the crown of Thryn. She requires a group of
    adventurers to infi ltrate and investigate Dragon Tooth tower. Her plan?
    Lure the dragon guard out with court politics. The reason? A strange
    dragon was sighted during a new moon, barely visible in the lightless
    sky, visiting Dragon Tooth. Since then, a brood of eggs has appeared.
    If all this be true, it can only mean one thing: Hydranax the Hungry has
    returned to Dragon Tooth, and means to roost there. If the dragon guard
    is hiding this, they are already corrupted by the blue dragon’s magic.
    _‘Go to the highest crags and fi nd what you can. All depends on this.’_

**Iron King Thromm, Lord of Stonemark**

_- Location:_ Stonemark Hall
_- Widely Known:_ King Thromm is lord of the Eastern dwarves, guardian
    of Runnminir, master of the Hammer Host. He is a famous reveler, ale-
    quaffer, and holder of ancient, honorable values.
_- Quest:_ Locking the Vaults: Fully engaged with fi ghting back invading
    orcs at Runnminir Gate, Thromm implores our heroes to embark
    on a risky mission into the depths of the undermountain. Using his
    Stoneborn Ring, they are to access the perilous Door of High Rock,
    and use newly cut passages to delve far below the mountain. There,
    ancient vaults holding evil things great and small have been damaged
    or opened by the orc incursions. The vaults must be closed and locked
    once again! _‘It will be a deadly, lonely, terrible journey... your chances_
    _of success are thin and of survival even thinner! So, what do you say?’_

**Sir Jormund Osrigard, Grand Champion of Thenne**

_- Location:_ Kaargfort
_- Widely Known:_ Sir Osrigard has won the all-realm tournament on
    King’s Field for the last three years. He has been decorated in a half
    dozen wars, and completed a number of near-immortal deeds many
    thought impossible. Pulling back from the spotlight to train a wave of
    young squires, he now resides in the cheese capital of Kaargfort, where
    his journey began years ago.
_- Quest:_ A Humble End: Hearing of our heroes’ deeds, Osrigard sends
    an invitation to the log-tossing festival at Kaargfort, promising the
    greatest revelry the realm has to offer. In truth, he seeks an errand
    from the adventurers. After a lifetime of heroism, he now wishes only
    to settle down and be of use to his community. He takes our heroes
    aside, revealing a secret... much of his power and success is owed to
    a magic jade pebble. This arcane stone was loaned to him by an old
    hermit who lives in the remote area of Greenstone. He begs the heroes
    to venture there, and to return the stone to the old man for him, with
    utmost discretion. He has so many admirers and dreamers around him,
    he would hate to disappoint them with knowledge of the pebble. _‘Will_
    _you take this back to the old man? Will you offer this knight one fi nal_
    _request... that I may know a humble end?’

## Infamous Villains

Player characters, even in their fl edgling days, have heard dread tales
of these tyrants, sadists, and dark lords. Once our heroes have completed
a few adventures, they will likely cross paths with one of these infamous
villains. Each is listed below with an introductory quest.

**Longshadow**

_- Location:_ Cairn Bay
_- Widely Known:_ Likely the most dreaded elder wizard in The North
    Holds, Longshadow is a real-life boogie man. Little is known about
    his origin, but all too many know the withering death of his arrival...
    always in the last rays of daylight.
_- Quest:_ The Ring of Keranzan: Moving in larger circles of infl uence, our
    heroes learn that Longshadow has returned along with his murderous
    cultists, building a strange tower in Cairn Bay. Scholars tell of a
    powerful ring that he uses to channel immense power. If the ring could
    be stolen... Longshadow’s newest plot could be foiled... _‘If you can fi nd_
    _the wizard’s new stronghold... he’ll keep the ring somewhere safe... not_
    _simply slipped onto a fi nger. A vault perhaps, or some high chamber_
    _hidden away...’_

**Nails**

_- Location:_ Cloudtop area
_- Widely Known:_ Also known as the ‘skeleton rider’ or ‘Dead Horse,’
    Nails is a being displaced from his own realm, wandering in a haze of
    rage and confusion in The Holds. He is seen as a cloaked skeleton in
    riding boots, black-brimmed hat, spurs and gun belts. Where the rider
    goes, death follows.
_- Quest:_ Back to Hell: Nails is terrorizing small towns, using enchanted
    fi rearms unlike any in The Holds, searching for someone named Dyre,
    and ranting about devils and angels. When a player character loses a
    family member to the marauder, the madness must be stopped. Rumor
    has it the rider cannot be killed, but can only be defeated by sending
    him back to the dimension the came from... but how? _‘I saw the rider_
    _out on Pete’s Bluff... just staring into the sunset, that black hat against_
    _the sky. A demon, I say! A demon from another time!’_

**Toad King Highlord Croakokame, Pikeborn, Emperor of Exodur,
Protector of the Marsh, Ruler of all Frogdom, architect of the Seventh
Age, Lord of the Swamp**

_- Location:_ Isle of Toads
_- Widely Known:_ There is no corner of the world where Croakokame is
    not known. He is one of the mightiest rulers ever to live. For over four
    hundred years he has reigned as seventh emperor... a titan. Even so,
    very few are allowed the privilege of even seeing his majesty.
_- Quest:_ One Consort Too Many: When Godiva Goodwin, a much-
    loved druid’s apprentice from Mooncrest, is kidnapped and taken to
    Croakokame’s bath houses to be his newest concubine, a movement
    grows to wage a near-suicidal rescue mission into the frog empire. Near
    the top of a short list of heroes for the job? You and your allies. No
    land-walker has ever laid eyes on the imperial palace of Croakokame
    and lived. When the mission seems impossible a wild card appears: a
    frogman warrior who has defected from the cruel empire...

**Kuggbang, Oggbang’s Father**

_- Location:_ Ogre Neck
_- Widely Known:_ Tales of the ogre nation have begun to spread, mostly
    that the High King of Thryn has beaten them in every battle since
    their appearance. Offi cial word from Thryn claims the war set to end
    in victory within a year... the ogre menace decimated. Oggbang, the
    current heir, has already gone missing, presumed dead.
_- Quest:_ Towering Treachery: Oggbang himself, a crowned Ogre prince,
    approaches the heroes in an isolated locale. He explains with great care
    and eloquence how the elves have waged a terrible genocidal war on
    his folk, that a truce must be reached, but that his father, Kuggbang,
    refuses to yield, preferring annihilation to dishonor. Oggbang has given
    up trying to convince his father, and now seeks help to evacuate a large
    contingent of ogre families from the peninsula before the elves unleash
    their fi nal, destructive assault. _‘Wait, wait! Before you go drawin’_
    _blades and slingin’ spells, hear me out, humans... or wait I’m not sure_
    _what you is- anyway! Hear me out little folk! Oggbang’s not here to_
    _hurt no one! Oggbang needs your help!’_

**Toad King Highlord Croakokame, Pikeborn, Emperor of Exodur,
Protector of the Marsh, Ruler of all Frogdom, architect of the Seventh
Age, Lord of the Swamp**

_- Location:_ Isle of Toads
_- Widely Known:_ There is no corner of the world where Croakokame is
    not known. He is one of the mightiest rulers ever to live. For over four
    hundred years he has reigned as seventh emperor... a titan. Even so,
    very few are allowed the privilege of even seeing his majesty.
_- Quest:_ One Consort Too Many: When Godiva Goodwin, a much-
    loved druid’s apprentice from Mooncrest, is kidnapped and taken to
    Croakokame’s bath houses to be his newest concubine, a movement
    grows to wage a near-suicidal rescue mission into the frog empire. Near
    the top of a short list of heroes for the job? You and your allies. No
    land-walker has ever laid eyes on the imperial palace of Croakokame
    and lived. When the mission seems impossible a wild card appears: a
    frogman warrior who has defected from the cruel empire...

## Infamous Villains

**Queen Hinnla of Harnmoor**

_- Location:_ Harnmoor Citadel
_- Widely Known:_ Ruler of dwarves in the west, Hinnla is the much-
    disputed heir to Azmagarr Farbrow, who was a long-reigning king. Her
    rule is tenuous, but her goals mighty. Ullur is seldom a place of peace.
_- Quest:_ The Astral Bridge: To win her people over, Hinnla has deployed
    a small fl eet of ships to verify an old legend: that there is a wizard’s
    gateway linking the shores of Ullur and The Chained Tower. If such
    a bridge could be found, it would be the greatest trade route ever
    discovered. Word of this search reaches our heroes, and the bounty is
    free choice from Hinnla’s treasure vaults to the heroes who succeed.

**Caligos the World-Drinker**

_- Location:_ Caverns below Runnminir
_- Widely Known:_ Caligos is only known as the ‘Nightmare Eye’ or
    ‘Drinker of Dreams.’ Exactly who or what it is remains a mystery...
    only that it is undeniably _there.
- Quest:_ Nightmare Walkers: A whitebeard scholar in Rivergate, a
    beloved old sage called Higgles, has been using lucid dreaming to
    unravel the enigma of Caligos. He has learned that a physical portal
    can be established, traversing the dream realm to meet Caligos in his
    own domain. As his research is completed, he disappears, prompting
    the aid of our heroes to follow in his footsteps.

**Hasgar the Dead, Usurped King of Ullur**

_- Location:_ Ullur’s Teeth wilderness
_- Widely Known:_ Hasgar is a defunct king, a Frost Giant some believe
    dormant. In truth, Hasgar is raising a fi ghting force to lay Harnmoor
    low once and for all... this is widely known, but seldom spoken of.
_- Quest:_ Prisoners of the Ice King: Princess Kaylia contacts our heroes,
    warning that the west may fall if Hasgar is not dealt with. She hatches
    an elaborate plan to be taken prisoner, along with the adventurers,
    and carted off to Hasgar’s ice mines. The mission? Find out what
    state Hasgar’s army is in, their plans, and any weaknesses they may
    possess... and get out in one piece.

**Obleth**

_- Location:_ The Fissures
_- Widely Known:_ Eons before land walkers arose, a breed of spider folk
    reigned supreme. In those nightmare times, darkness and bone-white
    webs ruled the land. She who fed upon all others was called Obleth.
    Obleth the Eater of Young. Some say she yet lives...
_- Quest:_ Below the Oakenwood: When young explorers go looking into
    the poisoned waters of Oakenwood, they fi nd much more than they
    bargained for: Obleth the Ancient is nesting far below the old growth
    forest, raising a new hatch of young for the fi rst time in a millennium.
    The hatch must be stopped, or The North Holds will be fl ooded with
    spiderkind.

**Dark Lord Royce of Blood Manor**

_- Location:_ Blood Manor
_- Widely Known:_ Lord Royce, nicknamed ‘The Avarice of Blood,’ is
    an arch vampire of the highest order... one who embraced evil rather
    than keep it at bay. Over the last three decades, his homicidal thirst for
    human fl esh has cast a terrible shadow on all. By decree, request, or
    vendetta, our heroes become entangled in a desperate play to end it.
_- Quest:_ Feast of Flesh: Once a decade, Royce invites a handful of nobles
    and lords to his opulent castle for a week of revelry, feasting, and
    indulgence. Lady Walcrest of Rivergate has one such invite, and plans
    to use it as a ruse to smuggle in a team of heroes. Their goal? Recover
    and contain the legendary fl ying sword called Alucarr, Royce’s greatest
    treasure. With this weapon secure, Walcrest means to draw him out and
    slay him once and for all. _“These clothes won’t do. If you want to slay_
    _an arch-vampire, you need to look the part.”_

Looks like plenty of ways to die out there.
These quest starters are for players. If you’re

## Orders, Guilds, & Trusts

There are a handful of long-lasting groups in The North Holds whose
history goes beyond all that is presently known. These exclusive, enduring
societies and chapters exist in secretive enclaves and hidden places. Not all
yet survive for righteous reasons, though. For the player, these groups may
be a goal of distant ambition, a source of fear, or a thing to be destroyed
for vengeance overdue. Either way, these are the orders, guilds, and trusts
of note in the realm.

**House of the Heron**

- There is a small order of stout folk who live between the Copper Peaks
    and the Frog Marshes. These dwarves were long ago shunned by their
    Ullur kin, cast out as ‘lowland dwellers’ or even called ‘mud mutts’
    by their own kind. They are a unique hybrid of dwarven resolve and
    froggish fi ghting style... stout folk in wicker hats, using curved blades,
    who follow a long-lost code of honor unlike any in the stout kingdoms.
- The Heron dwarves employ super-heavy armor, seldom removed, and
    the largest froggish weapons such as the odak, curved-blade spear, and
    gourd hammer. They are a secretive, formidable lot who prize personal
    honor and duty over all else, even loyalty to king or land.
- Beyond serving out errands of service to prove their courage, they seek
    a long-lost book called _‘Odakai Tomo,’_ or _‘Giant Sword Book,’_ which
    is believed to explain their banishment so long ago.

**Ruin’s Children**

- Before time was measured by men, fragments of a starfaring vessel fell
    from the sky. How it happened is lost, but one such shard was forged
    into the mightiest great sword ever known: Ruin.
- Ruin has had many stewards over the centuries, all of them meeting
    terrible deaths in its service. It has had many names, and even more
    stories. A blade larger than a northman, light as a feather, and sharp as
    a dragon’s fang.
- Ruin’s Children are those who study its history, devote themselves to
    serve those who dare carry it, and ensure the blade is not lost, destroyed,
    or mistreated. Know their gathering places by the symbol of a blade-
    down sword marked with a crude hourglass.

**The Blood Drinkers**

- Many are the disciples of Lord Royce the Avarice. Not all are vampires,
    or murderers, but they see doom as the best outcome for The Holds.
    They see Royce as a cleansing agent, a restart. They see death as the
    world’s custodian. This makes them dangerous, and hated.
- The infl uence of vampires and their servants can be found throughout
    the north, but it has reached an epidemic level in The Redwoods, Jay’s
    Rock, and Ashtown. Matters have only gotten worse after the recent
    eruption of Volcan, which has darkened the sky in the far Northeast.
- The goals of Royce are many: fi nding Orgidex the Watcher, forging
    intelligent swords, killing the infamous Admiral Akarov, and conjuring
    dimensional gateways to far-off realms.
- To join the Blood Drinkers, one need only pledge loyalty to one of its
    members, either by the spilling or drinking of blood. The latter does
    not offer immediate vampiric power, though. Those who walk that path
    move through a series of ghoulish stages: the blind, the houndmaster,
    the cryptkeeper, the eater-of-dead, and fi nally a fl edgling vampire
    proper. Disobedience or insolence during this slow transformation is
    met with burning-at-the-stake. This gruesome practice has dotted the
    northeast lands with terrible, charred landmarks.

**Ordo Viator**

- The _‘Nomads’ Guild’_ is a widely known organization of travelers,
    paid adventurers, highway guards, caravaners, and cartographers.
    Most towns have a waystop for their members, where job boards
    and supplies are made available with annual dues. This guild is not
    exclusive, requiring only that members adhere to standardized book-
    keeping to build the ever-growing repository of maps and geographical
    data kept by the guild’s headquarters in Rivergate.
- Foremost in Ordo Viator’s endeavors is archaeology. The chaos of the
    Bloodwing War is not entirely documented or understood. The loss of
    history in the Ruinmoor area, the fall of Rock Island just west of there,
    the destruction of the Ogre Neck peninsula, the disappearance of the
    Skandahar, and the fall of the ancient cathedrals of Temrin in the far
    south are just a few of the mysteries they seek to uncover.
- Ordo Viator is funded by a cabal of wealthy lords and private interests,
    with vast treasure holds in various towns.

**Udin’s Hammer**

- Law is often lost in worlds torn apart by war and decay. Not for these
    stalwarts, who hold the timeless nature of law as a personal vow. They
    are headquartered in Stonemark, where a council of whitebeards keep
    enormous stone-spined books of _‘Law Eternal.’_ To become a member
    requires a series of trials and errands, which repel most applicants.
    Those who prevail in these ordeals are awarded with equipment,
    authority, and magical secrets from lineages too old to fully recollect.
    Such graduates are known throughout the realm simply as _Arbiters_.
- Folk, especially in smaller settlements, look to Arbiters to hear and
    resolve all manner of trouble. It is not always a glamorous quest for
    justice, but these keepers-of-law do enjoy creature comforts wherever
    they travel.
- In recent years, corruption has stained Udin’s Hammer. Some Arbiters
    have gone too far, twisted the ancient spirit of law, or defi ed their vows
    of service to the whitebeards.

**The Ring of Leaves**

- As seeds serve the tree, as the river serves the stones, so these folk
    take it upon themselves to maintain the balance of nature. Their
    confederation is loosely kept, membership only being counted at each
    equinox in secret sabbaths known only to the sensitives and intuitives
    in their ranks. There is no clear path to join The Ring of Leaves, but its
    benefi ts are many.
- Calling themselves simply _‘leaves,’_ the members of this group are
    visited by none other than the mighty Greentooth, eldest being of The
    Holds, at an appointed time in their membership. It is said they are
    shown wonders, imbued with subtle powers, and made one with a pact
    as old as the stones on which they stand.
- There are those who see Greentooth and her leaves as an unchecked
    power: a thing too powerful to control and too neutral to trust. The new
    king of eastern Elves, Ithamel, is such a malcontent. He has ordered his
    agents to hunt down and destroy The Ring of Leaves. Many see this as
    treachery, and a schism is forming in elven lands. At the perilous head
    of this confl ict is Elayna, Ithamel’s queen, delicately maintaining the
    balance of it all, much as the leaves hold stewardship over the streams
    and groves of the hidden world.

**The Riders’ Guild**

- Horses are rare in The North Holds. Almost as rare as fl int-and-
    gunpowder fi rearms. In the case of the Riders’ Guild, the two go
    together. Membership here focuses on care and training of horses, as
    well as construction and use of blackpowder weapons.
- Unlike many orders in The Holds, The Riders’ Guild is skewed to a
    specifi c lineage, namely that of Proudfoots, who comprise most of its
    membership. Others are welcome, but seldom apply.
- The political and social purpose of this guild is somewhat unclear.
    They prize the protection and respect of their way of life over any
    alignment or loyalty to king or country. For this reason, some consider
    them outlaws or ruffi ans.
- Find their headquarters in the remote town of Hakburg, where a ‘town
    circle’ of members considers petitioners, _‘whoopin’ and a-whompin’_ in
    a ritual of revelry and fellowship.

**The Holy Order**

- The matter of gods and divinity has, over the centuries, coalesced in its
    various forms into a group called The Holy Order. This order has some
    novelty in that many gods and forms of worship are represented under
    a single ‘roof.’ Clergy here ponder and practice many faiths.
- The Holy Order fi nds much of its spiritual practice and contemplation
    in famed steam baths. This environment of wellness makes a sacred,
    and enjoyable, milieu for divine discourse. Almost every abbey has
    such baths, where the many faiths coexist.
- The abbeys of The North Holds are also home to powerful and
    experimental magic research. Many, dangerous, and ambitious are
    their projects.
- To join The Holy Order, one need only show a resounding faith in a
    deity or deities, and pledge to serve an abbey in whatever way one is
    useful. When this service is complete, the aspirant is sent abroad to
    spread faith, wisdom, and the ‘truth of many truths’ to the world.
- The Holy Order isn’t strictly stated as anti-infernal, but they have little
    love of the demonic or the undead. Despite this, their magic ambitions
    have led them down some dark corridors of late, causing a stir in
    the clergy’s leadership, and a new blight on their otherwise spotless
    reputation of piety.
