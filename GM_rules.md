## THE

# ENEMY


##### A Leaning StoneA Leaning StoneA Leaning StoneA Leaning Stone

###### The empire of frogs would have the world believe it is infi nite in power,

endless in reach. In some ways, this bravado rings true. The armies of
Croakakame are vast, but the sheer weight of the empire takes its toll
decade by decade. Not easily are such massive forces sustained, nor the
great sprawling temples maintained. So, after Bloodwing was destroyed,
the emperor drew much of his strength back from his frontiers to The Isle
of Toads. It was proclaimed the new heart of the frog nation, and tributes
were brought from far and wide to fund its renovation.

Since then, the efforts have fl oundered. Disruptive rebellions, natural
disasters, waning coffers, and a growing roster of enemies hinder the
emperor’s designs. Many frog-folk believe it is time for new leadership,
even an alliance with men and elves. This view is treason, and punished
accordingly. Still, there are those who do not fear the emperor’s gallows,
and those who would use his weakness to drive a wedge into the court
of toads. Of these agents, two met on a foggy night in the western marsh
lands.

“Here? Of all the mud-pits in the marsh, you summon me here?” Ketta
loosened her bogu, spun the belt-knot, and lifted her scabbards. There were
fi ve in all: three longswords, a sickle-dagger, and her odak. The scabbards
she deftly held in one hand, while lifting her bogu with the other. Her
legs she folded in traditional style, and descended to the bamboo mat,
weightless. She was frog-kin, highborn, fl awless and pale, with eyelashes
delicate as a butterfl y’s wings.

“There is no better beer in the west, Ketta. You look- well- beautiful as
ever, my lady.” Hez took a comical bow, a bucket-mug already half empty
in his left hand. From this bow, he looked up with a smile. Then came his
great laugh, booming and full and free of care. The mug he slammed to the
fl oor, then tumbled into her with a hug of beard and chainmail and clumsy
affection. “There are no words, Ketta. Gods and devils, I knew you were
alive. Those fools had no idea who they were messing with!”
“Hez, please.” She pushed him back, but had to smile. He was a century
older than her, but always a little brother, and the best friend one could
hope for. Stout folk had a way with friendship... they seldom wavered.
“Alright, alright, have I wrinkled your bogu? Ha! I knew you’d come!”


###### Hez and Ketta had been through all kinds of perils and adventures over

the years, but none more dangerous than to plot against Croakakame.
They kept their booth-door shut tight, and spoke in low tones. Not even
the defi ant spirits of the Herons would approve this treachery. They had to
tread with utmost care.

“I see how we get in, and the housekeepers can smuggle us to the upper
levels, but then what, draw steel and go berserk? Hardly a plan.” Ketta
sipped tea and snacked on fried trout.
“That’s the best part, big sister! All we need do is the ‘tett-froekn’ and
make our escape! The emperor’s rage is what we want, not blood spilled.”
“Tett- what?”
“An old stout folk tradition... a knock on the head to show no fear. A taunt.”
“You want to knock emperor Croakakame, supreme lord of the largest
army in The North Holds ‘on the head,’ and run away?”
“Exactly. So you have heard of it!” Hez took another quaff, gestured for
another bucket-mug. Three would be a fi ne night.
“Why leave him alive if we’re that close? A throat is easily cut, even the
throat of an emperor.”
“Silly goose. If we kill the old fart, the chaos will be- well, chaotic! If
we anger him, however, he will expend his resources pursuing us, saving
face. His honor will bleed him dry. Then, the rebellion can do all the heavy
lifting. We’ll be sipping sprout-rum in Cloudtop!”
“And if we don’t escape?”
“Well, he’ll skin us alive and no one will even know we tried.”
“A merciful description of what will happen.”
“I’m an optimist.”
“That, of all things in this plan, is abundantly clear.”
“I knew you’d like it!”
“Hez, you hammer-head, it’s terrible.” There was a long pause. Ketta sipped
her tea, folded her bogu over her lap and fl opped a red napkin on her bowl.
She looked up, studying Hez’s familiar face. He waited, barely breathing,
mug in hand, beard spilling onto the table like an orange waterfall.

“So?”
“I’m in.”

##### Dark Forces

###### Despite all the efforts and hopes of goodly folk across The North

Holds, evil yet lurks in the shadows, below the earth... in the hearts of the
malevolent, wrathful, or bloodthirsty.

Much of the peril that will defi ne our heroes arises in confronting, and
struggling to defeat, these evil forces and their legions. Some are monsters...
inhuman deformities, titanic destroyers, tragedies of poisoned nature or
dark magic. Others are those enthralled by ambitious lords, those driven to
desperate acts, or those simply numb to the violence of their own deeds.
Against all of these our heroes must strive. They are _the enemy_.

Not all enemies are evil. What is evil, after all? RPG players are famously
inquisitive about the motivation of those they seek to destroy. In The North
Holds, you have a few key reasons these foes are more than simple pests...

**Tyrants:** Since the disappearance of the Earl, and the fall of central rule
after the Bloodwing War, lesser warlords and would-be emperors are on the
rise. They take what isn’t theirs, enthralling their armies with brainwashing,
extortion, desperation, and deception.

**Predators:** Some enemies, mainly beasts, are simply in need of food. When
that preferred prey is humankind, or elves, stout folk or the proudfoots...
they cannot be left to run amok.

**Hatred:** Some species harbor generational hate for others. They have killed
and avenged for millennia. This type of enemy can be fi erce, fearless, and
brutal in a confrontation, certain they are _right_ to kill their foe.

**The Infl uence of Caligos:** Finally, there is the growing dark in The
North Holds; the mysterious ‘Avarice of Blood’ poisoning the land with
malevolent hunger... an entity or force called Caligos. Not all evil traces
back to this root, yet it is the doom of the present age. Heroes will encounter
this blood-like ichor in their travels, perhaps choosing to trace it to its roots
deep below ground, or destroying its more powerful agents. Caligos can be
called a monster, but it is more... an immortal, ever-present aspect of reality
itself. How can such evil be defeated? Who knows...

###### Enemies are not as detailed as heroes. Here’s the shorthand for their

details. You’ll be checking these as GM during play.

```
Enemies have 5 STATS: HP, ATK, DEF, PHASE, and TACTICS
```
**HP:** A simple pool of hit points. At 0 hit points, the foe is killed.

**ATK:** Enemies do not roll their attacks. Rather, players defend with their
own rolls. The ATK stat is a penalty to a player Defense roll.

**DEF:** Enemies have Defenses to resist attack. DEF is subtracted from a
hero damage roll. Some attacks degrade DEF, such as the degrading armor.

**PHASE:** Enemies take actions in 1 or more of the 5 phases in a round, up
to 3 phases maximum per round!

**TACTICS:** When their phase comes up, monsters do 1-3 actions called
tactics. As GM, roll a D6 to select a tactic.

**- Tactic roll 1** (displacement, dash, movement, target change or regroup)
**- Tactic roll 2-5** (common attack)
**- Tactic roll 6** (area of effect attacks that hit all or all-near foes)

A tactic will also include what type of attrition it will infl ict...

**- Basic:** When hit, victim chooses any 1 skill or equipment inventory to
    mark off. Equipment is only damaged.
**- Flesh:** When hit, victim rolls D10, marks off the indicated skill.
**- Equipment:** When hit, randomly select and cross off 1 equipment.
    Equipment is only damaged, not destroyed.
**- Destroy:** When hit, cross off 1 randomly selected skill and destroy 1
    randomly selected piece of equipment.
**- Brutal:** When hit, victim marks off 1D6 combined skill and equipment
    inventory, randomly selected.

**Move-to-Engage:** Enemies need not be bound to tactics rolls at all times.
They may just _move-to-engage,_ getting in attack position or range before
rolling tactics. Enemies tend to use _move-to-engage_ to reach their most
recent or most severe attacker.

These creatures have 4 size categories, the largest being 8-10’ feet
in height. They appear in groups of 2D8 individuals of various
sizes, dwelling in caverns or other dark places. In each group, one
variant form is always found, this usually being the largest or oldest
specimen in its pod.
```
```
Variant Form: Poison Slimer: This variant mushroom is always
size 4. Its attacks infl ict a poison condition which will repeat its
fl esh attrition attacks for 4 rounds after impact unless cured with a
potent poison antidote.
```
```
Variant Form: Sapper Gill: These fungi have characteristic, deep
red gills beneath the cap. Rather than doing the squirt attack, they
will seek melee range, fl opping gooey gills onto prey. This attack
infl icts destroy attrition, and drains blood through corrosive suction,
recovering 2D10 HP for the mushroom if successful.
```

destruction. Also destroys structures completely
-Tactic 6: Flame Strafe! Same as Flame Breath above, but the
dragon uses its fi re breath while fl ying over foes
```
```
Frenzied Dragons: If reduced to half its HP or less, a dragon may
become frenzied. In this state, it is enraged, impulsive, desperate
for a mouthful of blood and bones. As above, but change tactics...
-Tactic 1: The dragon stomps after whoever hit it last, brutal attrition
-Tactic 2-5: Squash! The dragon uses huge claws to swat and crush
foes. Infl icts basic attrition. If so hit, victim is stunned for 1 round
-Tactic 6: Dozer Jaws! The dragon fl ies in, scooping rocks, trees,
people, and everything else into its jaws. Evade only to avoid. If
scooped up, escape by some means or be killed instantly at the start

Muck afterwards. Use a D6 roll below to select the spell cast
-Tactic 6: A Fine Liar. Bog Witches can perfectly imitate voices and
appearances to lure prey. They often choose helpless or innocent
forms such as children. If this tactic is rolled, the witch throws
her voice or fl its for cover while deceiving a victim with lies. Roll

witch’s foes are engulfed, sinking to the necks, escaping by Muscle
roll or other means, unable to take any other action until free

victim of her choice. This causes 2 equipment attrition instantly
4: Regenerate- The witch heals 10 HP
5: Fire Spurt- A gout of fl ame bursts from the ground! 1D4 heroes
suffer basic attrition
6: Fog of Death- A thick, opaque fog fi lls the scene. Visibility is
limited to arm’s length, but the witch sees as normal. Once cast, the
fog lasts 1D4 rounds and is expended/not cast again

-Tactic 2-5: Weapon attacks. The knight employs any 2 weapons,
swinging at 1 or 2 targets as needed, infl icting fl esh attrition with one
(bladed) and equipment attrition with the other (mace or hammer)
-Tactic 6: Rushing charge! With a supreme effort, the knight sprints
a short distance, leaning into a powerful attack that can only be
Evaded to avoid. This infl icts brutal attrition and stuns the victim
for the remainder of the round.
```
```
Knights are the armored elite in the employ of lords, earls, kings
and queens. They are brutal fi ghting machines, especially skilled
at surviving protracted battles, steadily advancing, or confi ning the
enemy to be killed by archers or fi re.

-Tactic 2-5: Woodshroom spears! Stab! Stab! Basic attrition
-Tactic 6: Spore cloud! With a squeeze of torso muscles, they emit
a dense cloud of microscopic spores, active on contact with the skin
of all those nearby. Can only be avoided with Evade. Roll for spore
type below.
```
```
Myconoids are a diverse folk who live in the deep underworld,
unable to withstand the intensity of sunlight. They are entirely
fungal in biology, cultivating lesser fungi and growing immense
mushroom species for housing, lumber, and other needs.
```
```
Little is known of Myconoid society, save that they prefer to avoid
entanglements with surface folk and their many confl icts.
```
```
Myconoids range from 3 feet to 7 feet in height, in many colors
and shapes, with small button eyes below the cap. Some can speak,
some cannot.
```
```
When using Spore Cloud, the Myconoid can choose its spore type
for strategy, or it can be rolled at random.
```
**1. Stinging Spores:** This fi ne yellow dust burns eyes and skin
    with fl esh attrition. The cloud lingers 1 round.
**2. Corrosion Cloud:** A reddish poof of acidic spores eats through
    leather and metal, causing equipment attrition. The cloud
    dissipates immediately.
**3. Mind Haze:** These almost invisible spore particles establish a
    mind-link with the host Myconoid. This allows them to ‘puppet’
    the victim for 1 round.
**4. Incendiary Spores:** This spore cloud is directional, jetting
    away from the source. All those within are blasted with a fi ery
    cloud, suffering brutal attrition. The cloud then vanishes.

##### When Creating Enemies

###### Creating and statting enemies can get cumbersome, no matter how

streamlined your rules may be. Try these tricks to help.

**Standard HP:** Use three categories to rapidly set HP on created enemies:
5 HP, 25 HP, or 50 HP. These simple amounts can be used for a great many
foes, and give players a sense of mass or size driving HP.

**Dice for ATK:** Roll 1D10 for ATK or simply assign a value of 0.

**Dice for DEF:** Most enemies have 1D6 DEF. Add D6s to escalate tough,
naturally armored, scaly or steel-clad foes.

**Attrition Style:** Generally, choose one for your created enemy.

**- Basic:** When hit, victim chooses any 1 skill or equipment inventory to
    mark off. Equipment is only damaged.
**- Flesh:** When hit, victim rolls D10, marks off the indicated skill.
**- Equipment:** When hit, randomly select and cross off 1 equipment.
    Equipment is only damaged, not destroyed.
**- Destroy:** When hit, cross off 1 randomly selected skill and destroy 1
    randomly selected piece of equipment.
**- Brutal:** When hit, victim marks off 1D6 combined skill and equipment
    inventory, randomly selected.

_*No matter what an enemy’s attrition style may be, hitting a hero who has
no inventory left is a lethal blow. A hero so hit will die on the next phase 5
unless healed for 1 or more skill inventory._

**Tactics Classics:** To simplify the tactics roll of an enemy, use these three
classics, all with the same attrition style. As the enemy gains personality,
these can be made more fl avorful and varied.

**- 1: Move and Recover:** The enemy relocates, gathers strength.
**- 2-5: Melee attack:** A standard single-target claw or weapon attack.
**- 6: Area attack:** The enemy uses a spin, ground-pound, cleave or magic
    attack to hit all heroes at once.

###### With the brief enemy lists included here, the GM will quickly come upon

a need for a custom monster. As you create monsters, use the guidelines on
page 284 to get started. Then, spice things up with modifi cations. Follow
the steps below, then use the D12 tables on pages 286 and 287.

**Roll a Modifi cation:** Jump to the next page and roll a D12. Add that
change to your unique version-of-an-enemy and proceed. In time, you’ll
do this without even thinking.

**Roll an Event:** Also on the next page spread, roll a D12 to add a ‘second
mode’ to your unique enemy. This will give any battle with the foe a two-
part feeling that will challenge players, or make the enemy feel like a
leader, alpha, or ancient variant.

**Give it a Name:** Always give a creepy, weird, or scary name to modifi ed
enemies. Even keeping it simple like ‘Ancient Blue Hag’ or ‘Giant Cavern
Crab’ sets it apart. For bonus points, name the modifi ed enemy as an
individual... spoken of in myth, feared by locals, or created in a wizard’s
tower.

**Give it Loot:** Unique, ancient, or alpha-level foes should have 1 or 2
treasure items on them when slain. These can be bits that are ‘harvested’
like eyeballs and teeth, or dropped equipment. Use tables as needed to give
players that tingle of fi nding goodies when victory is earned.

##### When Modifying Enemies

##### Enemy Modifications

###### Ok, let’s get to the mechanical stuff. You’ll see the TACTICS terms

below all over the monster entries in this book. Mix & match to create your
custom foes in no time, or use a D12 for a random property.

**1. Heavy Attacks:** This enemy is effective at getting past hero Defenses,
    gaining a +5 ATK.
**2. Armored:** Add this variation to an enemy to reinforce it with defl ective
    plates, scales, or other Defenses. It gains +5 DEF.
**3. Destroyer:** This foe has a special reason for a gear-crushing attack.
    This attack infl icts destroy attrition.
**4. Brutal Attrition:** This enemy’s attacks infl ict 1D6 attrition.
**5. Stun:** If hit by this powerful foe, the victim is rendered senseless for 1
    ROUND, dazed and concussed.
**6. Equipment Attrition:** Sundering enemies only target item attrition.
**7. Bloody Attacks:** This foe targets fl esh and bone only. Cross off skill
    inventory only when hit. For extra impact, and a bleed effect... infl icting
    another skill attrition 1D4 round after the initial strike.
**8. Fast:** This enemy variation rolls tactics in 3 phases. As a shortcut, use
    phases 1, 3, and 5.
**9. Huge:** This foe has twice the HP of its cousins.
**10. Blast:** On tactic 6, this enemy uses an area attack like so many others,
    but teh effect can only be avoided by an Evade roll. To push it even
    further, the ‘blast’ cannot be avoided at all!
**11. Swipe:** This special property affects all heroes present, shoving them
    a near distance. Determine direction with a scatter die or clock roll.
    Particularly deadly when used near dropoffs or pits.
**12. Recovery:** This enemy uses one of its actions each round to recover
    strength. When this occurs, replenish D100% of the enemy’s HP
    maximum. Use a rough estimate with this roll to save time and make
    things easy.

###### Every battle can benefi t from a twist or a turn... something that scrambles

the actions, forces movement, or utilizes the terrain. Choose below or roll
a D12 for the moment things get a little crazy.

**1. Frenzy:** At half HP this enemy goes berserk, adding a new phase to its
    regular set of actions.
**2. Explosive Displacement:** Desperate, this enemy makes a violent
    movement to a remote part of the scene, delivering an area attack en
    route. This can also restart the encounter to phase 1.
**3. Parasites:** After being hit 3 times, the enemy shakes or convulses,
    releasing a swarm of 2D6 1 HP parasite enemies.
**4. Terrain Damage:** On every third turn, this foe destroys a piece of the
    scene. If a hero is occupying this area, they fall, are crushed, or become
    pinned/trapped by the destruction.
**5. Self Destruct:** After reaching 1/4 HP, the enemy activates a self-
    destruct sequence. It will explode or melt in 1 round.
**6. Possessor:** The enemy retreats, then uses magic to occupy an unwilling
    host body. This effect lasts 1 round.
**7. Final Form:** At 0 HP, instead of dying, the enemy changes form,
    unfolds, or reveals its true self... an upgrade of its previous form.
**8. Submission:** At 1/4 HP this enemy will submit, yielding to heroes.
    This isn’t a ruse, but a full surrender.
**9. Lair Regroup:** At 1/2 HP the enemy hurries to its base of operations,
    recovering HP and gathering strength to continue fi ghting.
**10. Vanish:** Using magic, terrain, or weather, this enemy disappears!
**11. Accelerant:** If this event is rolled, the enemy accelerates any current
    timers on the table by 1D4 rounds.
**12. Split:** At 1/2 HP the foe splits in two, cloning itself. Each clone has 1/2
    the original max HP of the enemy. The clones work together tactically,
    dividing or decoying, or evading their attackers with cunning.

##### A Leaning StoneA Leaning StoneA Leaning StoneA Leaning Stone

###### Spruce and her friends had been on their boots for three straight days, her

friend Ira choked with soot and hornet welts, and little Lucille exhausted
by dwarven suitors. It was an errand of frogs and fi re, of broken bricks and
cold-water plunges. Fort Abbervale was still held by the croakers, but the
soldiers were safe. Never was the walk home from the lookout so long.

On their way they walked with wider and wider space ‘tween them, the
stout folk far ahead, eager for home. Spruce tarried, wistful, nostalgic for
simpler days. It had only been a week since Granes had ‘volunteered’ them,
and she had already had her fi ll of heroics. The urge to vanish into the trees
was ever-present, but there was the alderman to think about, and the girls,
and loneliness nagging.

“Not a drop of frog-blood spilled! Imagine the tales they’ll tell!”
“I’d rather a heap of coin than a pinch of fame,” Ira added from the front.
“The house could use a new bartop. That slab is showing its age.”
“Bartop? You old spinster, I make for the tavern! We’ve not had a reveling
for weeks.”
At last Spruce, little Shushannah, spoke up on the matter. “I’d settle for a
warm hug, a gentle kiss light as rain, and a fl ower to brighten the moment.”
The other two girls froze, giggled, then started making belch noises.
“You’re hopeless!”

Back in the vine-wound avenues of Gardenburrow, they were greeted
with nervous faces, worried hustling. Of the four groups deployed by
the Alderman, only they had returned. No word from Kaargfort, and the
Oakenwood explorers had vanished entirely. Worry clouded the dusk.

“Gloomy as ever.”
“I’ve got a bad feeling about this,” Spruce said, ascending the steps of the
_Suede & Saddle_. “I hope everyone gets back safe.”
“The gods will see it done,” Lucille comforted, started to worry herself.

At that moment, two guards rounded the bend at Hickory Alley. Their
slotted helmets were ominous, their spears at ready.


###### Who can know what really happened in the shadow-soaked Oakenwood

in the hours and days before that moment? Great, lumbering arachnid
shapes had been seen, and thus the scouts deployed, but the two days since
were plagued with a lack of news. This quiet became concern, and the
guards showed it. They met the eyes of the ladies as they passed.

“Good to see you returned safe, brave women of the Burrow!” The fi rst
guard was cordial, stiff, mind still on his work.
“Abbervale Fort remains in froggish hands, boys. It will take a detachment
to uproot those things.” Ira pulled off one muddy boot with effort.
“All in time,” the second guard added, with a softer tone. He gestured to
his partner, who nodded. Then over he leaped, in three quick strides, to the
steps of the ladies’ sometimes-public house.
“Lady Spruce, a word?”
Shushannah blushed, turned like a frightened deer, then fl oated down the
fi rst two steps... a wisp of cool mist in the fading light.
“What is it?”
“I wanted to thank you. I know the alderman has put much pressure on you
and your company, but you heard my plea, and ventured to Abbervale. It’s
no small thing to see you returned.”
“You fl atter me. Ira did all the fi ghting, and Lucille here-”
“I did not come to speak to them, with all due honors, lady Spruce. For
now, I’ve my own duties to perform, and no doubt trouble on the southern
wall by morning.”
“And so?”
“-Uh, and so-” He fumbled a bit then, removing his helmet. His hair was
tight cropped, mostly combed, but messy to one side. The eyes were a
kind green, the jaw square with youth, and he had a smile that softened the
sunset. “A token... to hope that we speak again.” With that, he plucked the
blue plume from the helmet’s crest, a weightless, vibrant thing, a sign of
rank and deeds done. This he handed to her, replacing the helm and hiding
his shy eyes in shadow once more.
“Why, thank you. I don’t even know your name.’
“Nolan.”

When Spruce turned, Nolan on his way, the other girls clucked with glee.

###### Throughout The North Holds, lush plant life offers a variety of benefi ts

to the wayward adventurer. Here are all the basics needed to become a
skilled herbalist...

- An herbalist rolls the Forager skill to discover a variety of plants
    depending on terrain. Successful foraging rolls earn 1 herb, fungus,
    root, or plant.
- In the event of a failed attempt to fi nd herbs, the player will face a -3
    penalty if searching in the same area again.
- This discovery penalty stacks with the terrain penalties listed below. A
    failed attempt at a discovery roll in the desert will result in a -8 penalty
    on a repeat attempt (-3 failed discovery/-5 terrain)!
- The **Herbalist’s Pouch** can store 4 plants at a time. If the pouch is full,
    a plant must be used or discarded before a new one can be added. This
    item is a 3-point piece of equipment.
- Upon making a fi nd, roll 1D8 to determine what will be harvested.
    Generally, a roll of 1 is toxic specimen: The forager must roll their
    Forager skill again to avoid poisoning themselves. A roll of 2 is
    immature or not-yet-useful bits, and a roll between 3 and 8 offers
    quality specimens of ascending utility.
- Herbs, roots, plants and fungi cannot be foraged in urban, blighted,
    lifeless, or volcanic environments.
- Consuming or using herbs is considered a ‘free’ or instantaneous action,
    using no appreciable amount of time in a player’s turn. Still, only 1
    herb may be consumed per turn, allow for chewing and digestion.
- The effects of herbs are doubled by cooking. This requires a full rest
    period such as camping, and can give off powerful smells that may
    bring undesired attention.

At fi rst, this druid, Aure, was little more than an

**1. Rotting Moonfl ower:** _Debilitating hallucination that causes_
    _petrifi cation, roll Resist to prevent_. The sap here has begun to boil in
    the desert sun causing its toxins to seep through the skin’s pores. As the
    plant is being harvested, the weakened skin dissolves to the touch and
    coats the harvester’s hand.
**2. Adolescent Moonfl ower:** _No effect._ See below.
**3. Mature Moonfl ower:** _Astral projection_. This is a hallucinogenic plant,
    its use perfected by desert shamans over centuries... it allows the user
    to manifest themselves out-of-body as an astral projection. Shamans
    would use this to communicate across vast distances without having
    to brave the harsh terrain and temperatures of the desert. In combat
    it can confuse the enemy as an illusion, and is an excellent scouting
    tool. The risk lies in plant identifi cation. It is easy to confuse a mature
    Moonfl ower with an adolescent or even rotting Moonfl ower. The outer
    skin of the plant remains a bright ashen blue throughout its entire life.
    The inner sap, the consumable in which the hallucinogenic benefi ts
    reside, is only ripe for a short amount of time. The only way to safely
    determine ripeness is monitor its growth from seed.
**4. Mirage Brush:** _Used for safe rest, 1-in-6 chance of detection_. Dry
    brush that tumbles about. Desert shamans commonly add this plant
    to their campfi re because the smoke is oily and lingers in the air. This
    masks campers in a blurry shroud, offering reliable concealment.
**5. Black Torch Plant:** _Adds 1D6 fi re damage_. An ominously beautiful
    plant, turning from green to black in maturity. As the plant nears
    maturity it sprouts a fl ower of yellow, red and orange that resembles a
    torch. If the petals are disturbed, the fl ower ignites in fl ame.
**6. Stonecrop:** _Absorbs 1 skill attrition_. Disguised as rocks, the Stonecrop
    have a distinct green-yellow hue. Ripe, they resemble a peach and
    consuming them grants strength of will. Very often overlooked and
    little-known.
**7. Wanderer’s Aloe:** _Heal 1 skill attrition_. Adolescent version of
    the Shaman’s Aloe. It received its name due to non-native travelers
    harvesting the plant before it was fully matured.
**8. Shaman’s Aloe:** _Heal 2 skill attrition._ A camoufl aged tan bulb full of a

**5. Golden Rhus:** _Re-roll any 1 roll._ These fl owers bloom on small trees.
    They can be seen shimmering from a distance, often confused with

**6. Slough Pine:** _Add 1D8 to damage for 1 round._ This sap is applied to a
    weapon. Once applied, it cannot be removed.
**7. Daughter Of Twilight:** _Heal 1 skill attrition._ Twilight plants are one of
    the wonders of The North Holds while still only growing 3’ at its tallest.
    The fl owers of the twilight plant bloom at dusk. As the adolescent
    buds open, a cold glowing light emits from the fl owers, reminiscent of

acts very quickly. Because it camoufl ages itself onto a rocky surface, it is
hard to detect and often catches the unsuspecting traveler off guard. One
mistep on this hidden lichen sends a brutal chill into the feet.
**2: Alga Dleoff:** _No effect._ In lean times, dwarven miners deep in the
mountains sate their hunger by scraping dleoff, a cheese-like lichen, off
the cavern walls and enjoying with bread. A fi ne nutty fi nish.
**3: Alga Devra:** _Adhere to surfaces for 1D4 rounds._ Devra acts like a
super-adhesive. Dwarven miners use this lichen on rope for extra grip
while hauling large portions of stone. Use this lichen for safe climbing,
reinforcing doors, or any binding-of-objects.
**4: Alga Gevroraldr:** _Illuminate for 2D6 rounds._ Dwarves of the north
learned about this lichen from wayfaring druids, who often camp in
a soothing blue light. Gevroraldr glows when crushed in hand. More
importantly, all living things within gevroraldr’s gentle blue light are
protected from extreme cold.
**5: Alga Hegsgor:** _Avoid contact for 1D6 rounds._ The aroma of hegsgor
is unbearable. Dwarves have caved in entire mines just to rid themselves
of the stench. No creature that can smell hegsgor may contact the user,
including melee attacks, until the scent wears off.
**6: Alga Jroinni:** _Dissolves non-organic matter._ Druids use this lichen to
break down metals. Jroinni is found in small stone pockmarks created
by the lichen itself. Applying jroinni to any non-organic equipment will
dissolve and destroy it in 1D6 phases. Combine a large amount of this
lichen with slow-cooking to break down larger objects.
**7: Alga Hrenga:** _Summon elemental._ Hrenga is an odd organism that
absorbs elemental properties on contact. If crushed and applied to stone,
for example, it forms into a small stone being, able to move and act freely.
This effect works with stone, water, ice, or wood. The creature dissipates
after 1D8 rounds.
**8: Alga Okumudov:** _Commune._ Touching this mysterious lichen with
an Investigate roll allows the harvester to literally feel what okumudov is
feeling, for up to 1 mile. The information is vague and intuitive, seldom
verbal.

##### Rare Books

###### In the years after Bloodwing was destroyed, many of the institutions

normally charged with the preservation of stored knowledge fell to
ruin or obscurity. As the decades wore on, books grew in rarity, kept in
private libraries or moldering in forgotten tombs. Among this dwindling
supply of tomes, there are several sought-after classics, powerful magical
cyclopedias, and cursed volumes. To fi nd even one such book would be a
kingly discovery, to be copied by hand at almost any expense. To fi nd a
complete multi-volume set? Fully intact? Almost unthinkable.

Included here is a listing of the nine most infamous examples of these
sought-after works in The North Holds.

**A Note on Books:** Unlike many treasures, books are perishable. They rot,
bleed, fall to dust, have missing pages, are destroyed by water and fi re, and
can be forged with relative ease. For these reasons, they must be verifi ed,
analyzed, preserved, and curated with expertise in order to be of use.
Players and GMs are encouraged to consider these diffi culties if legendary
books are sought or acquired.

**Book Expertise:** As books became rarer, more diffi cult to assemble in sets,
expertise in book history, editions, comparison, authentication, forgery and
the like became a valuable skill. Treat this as a normal KNOWLEDGE
SKILL if adding to a character. Players could even describe a version of
the STUBBORN FLAW that makes them obstinate when books are close
at hand or imperiled.

**Player Knowledge:** GMs should consider carefully when allowing players
to preview information about infamous books, and only reveal vague
elements until the books are acquired.

```
Of course Gezaban wanted to fi nd the Libram
Arcanica! We followed the clues, got our beards
scorched in that fi re trap, and got bamboozled
by that gods-forsaken swamp hag. After all that,
the book was a fake. What a waste!

###### R ituals of Blood

```
‘By the river below, by the life-fl ow of mortals and the teeth of the dead,
by the torn kingdom and the broken vaults... so do these rituals gain their
power. Mark not idly these starfallen symbols. Blood for blood.’
```
This book is bound in scaled hide with a red spine. It is a very large book
and cannot be easily transported. The massive tome contains exactly 600
pages, arranged in 6 cantos or chapters. Each of these chapters contains
a complex ritual of dark magic. If the book is intact, all six rituals can be
learned. If damaged, it contains 1D6 intact ritual descriptions.

- Each ritual requires 1 week of uninterrupted study to translate and
    comprehend. Once comprehended, it is considered learned
- To cast, each ritual requires its caster to make 4 consecutive magic
    rolls. If a roll is failed, the count starts again
- If an attempt to cast is initiated and never fi nished, the caster is affl icted
    with blood sickness. This illness permanently reduces maximum skill
    inventory to 5. The sickness also infl icts a thirst for warm blood as a
    tincture or tonic

**Ritual 1: The Call of Caligos:** Cast this spell on a surface with red chalk.
The glyph drawn will become a portal to the nearest ‘black pool’ used by
Caligos and other deep-earth elder Stalac Stones.
**Ritual 2: Arcos Risen:** Crush a gemstone, summoning Arcos, a lesser
devil. Arcos will obey for 1D4 days, then do as he pleases.
**Ritual 3: Blood Plate:** Cast on a pool of water. When complete, reach in
and withdraw a set of +5 Defense platemail, blood red. The armor adds the
DEADLY EFFECT to any weapon attack by the wearer.
**Ritual 4: Ulien’s Shadow:** Evoke a massive dark shadow. It is several
hundred yards wide and pitch black, and will remain until dispelled.
**Ritual 5: Orgo Salvut:** This cryptic spell cannot be described in a static
fashion. The reader manifests the spell. To do so, the player is invited to
build a custom spell with a net cost not exceeding 50 points
**Ritual 6: Geas of Vampyres:** This dangerous spell can affl ict a single
target with a full-blown vampiric curse. The caster must have a sample of
their target’s hair, skin, fi ngernails, or other such material.

###### T he Blackmoor Sleep Experiment

```
‘In time, our deprivation of sleep to the subjects led to an eventual
‘dream affl iction’ when sleep was fi nally allowed. This affl iction led to
our ultimate breakthrough: that the Caligos entity moves, not through
physical space, but through the liminal corridors of the dream realm.
In so doing, it both feeds on the dreamer and propagates its vampiric
contagion through physical contact.’
```
Almost a century before the disappearance of the Earl, these experiments
were performed. The purpose was to discover and control a chemical cause
of _undeath_. The mad Earl, desperate to fi ght the lycanthropic Skandahar,
set these experiments in motion to create an undead fi ghting force. Instead,
he uncovered a terrible evil, and created the fi rst vampires in The North
Holds. In addition to recording the experiments, the book outlines the
results, and those who partook of the formula... a veritable family tree of
vampires in the realm.

- The Experiments can be studied in detail, given 1 full month of
    uninterrupted research. Given this effort the experiments can be
    recreated (with willing subjects) to channel Caligos the dream walker.
    Those visited by Caligos in such a way can then be ensanguinated. This
    blood is reduced via a specifi c process to create a single potent dose of
    pure vampirism.
- The book also documents those who ingested the fi rst fully developed
    doses of vampirism. These subjects are a choice few who went on to
    become the realm’s arch-vampires: Admiral Roman Akarov, believed
    to be the fi rst to take the serum, who eventually disappeared after the
    Skandahar war. The Earl of Blackmoor, then-ruler of The North Holds.
    Elsa Von Garett, the only elf known to have taken the vampiric agent.
    And Marduk Kane, a loner and forest-walker who disappeared in the
    west shortly after the experiments.
- Further information on the entity called Caligos, and the exact nature
    of vampiric contagion, is poorly detailed. The book concludes with a
    large swath of unfi nished pages, some of them stained with blood, torn,
    or scorched.

###### S piral Tree, Vols. 1-20

```
‘The seeker, in time, fi nds a confl uence between the forces of nature and
the forces of the arcane. Magical power is widely understood to derive
from alchemical processes, but these processes only recreate, in small
imitation, those mysteries and workings that underpin all living things,
and the animus that gives life its subtle powers.’
```
Spiral Tree is a series of bark-bound tomes originally written in twenty
volumes. Each book is a compact size, but the complete set occupies one
full shelf on any typical library. The covers and spines are easily spotted by
the expert, festooned with green-foil fi ligree and vine motifs. The contents
of Spiral Tree are largely intuitive and spiritual, serving as meditations for
the reader in the channeling of natural magic. Therefore, while the same
concepts can be found in any given volume, the comprehension of the
set in totality is said to unlock the deepest comprehension of its precepts.
Unfortunately, events in The Holds have scattered many such sets. All too
seldom are all twenty books seen together.

**Any 1 Volume:** The mind opens when fi rst encountering the concepts in
Spiral Tree. _‘All living things are connected in a great and turning vortex
of energies. Channeling its power is a matter of synchronicity, not control.’_

- Gain +1 Magic

**Any 10 Volumes:** After completing the text in half the set, the reader
gains deeper comprehension of the natural and the arcane, gaining applied
knowledge and not just theory. _‘In oneness with life, there is power.’_

- Gain +3 Magic
- Gain a custom spell of net 35-point cost, usable in natural environs
- Gain the ability to conjure _Lifestones_. With each night of bedrest,
    awaken with 1D4 small seed-like gems. Each heals 1 skill attrition.

**All 20 Volumes:** In its entirety, Spiral Tree holds incredible power.

- Gain +1 Investigation and +1 Magic
- If casting spells in a natural location; double the spell’s output.

###### C anto Octachorum

```
‘Gezaban’s Foreword: If the aspirant hopes to break the Canto’s
cypher, there is plenty of practical research available. For my meager
contribution, a decade of work has only broken one aspect of the coded
text: that letters in the fi rst canto are re-mapped onto the next adjacent
face of an octahedral volume, alternating on the vertical axis and leaping
within the eight-sided cube with each consecutive canto. The reader will
be dismayed to know, however, that this volume is also represented in the
text as moving through time, thus adding a continuous differential that
remains a complete mystery to its devotees.’
```
The Canto Octachorum is a book composed entirely in code. It uses letters,
numbers, and arbitrary symbols, with a revolving or ever-changing cypher.
The pages are not presented in order. Over 6,000 pages are known so far,
using a system of edgemarks to indicate orientation and sequence that was
only recently deciphered. The most complete copy known is kept in Thryn,
studied day and night for decades by the elven scholars there.

A new sect of Canto devotees has emerged in recent years, moving mostly
in secret to steal the existing copies and re-order them. They can be detected
by the symbol of a blue rooster. Little is known of this secretive group or
its progress with the text.

This book is valuable due to the prestige of its preface, written by its
inimitable author: Anaximios the Locust Mage. Legend holds that
Anaximios arrived in The North Holds from some distant dimension,
traveling here exclusively to offer the text and guidance for its use. Since
then, the Locust’s whereabouts remain unknown.

If an intact copy of Canto Octachorum is acquired...

- Take the PURSUED FLAW. The sect of the blue rooster will hunt you
- A reader with a languages skill of 20 can begin to decode the text. After
    1 month of dedicated work, the text can be superfi cially understood.
- Once the month is complete, gain an UN-CREATE spell: Infl icts 5
    attrition to cast, un-create a touched target from all its timelines, future
    and past. Can only be cast 1D4 times, then vanishes from all existence.

###### C astigere’s Meditations

```
‘Most common folk know of my work in the east, my presence in the
battlefi elds of Mooncrest, and my vow to see the dead of our world
treated with respect and care. I have been blessed with a bountiful life
of service to many gods and saints. This book documents some of my
learnings over the years, gods willing.’
```
Saint Castigere Villaroyas Antares lived three centuries before the
Bloodwing calamity. He even served a stint as king in his younger years,
working to create the unity so enjoyed by the Earl in later epochs. He made
an eternal vow to see the dead consecrated, blessed, and properly laid to
rest. His apparition is still seen to this day, humbly rolling his cart in gold
and white robes, whistling a little tune in the moonlight.

This book is a masterful and, compared to some on this list, concise work
on a pantheon of gods and immortals in The Holds, treated as a sort of court
or village of characters to know and appreciate. Castigere takes a novel
approach, considering _divine personality_ over boons offered or worship
of power. As such, the text has a friendly, relaxed feel that has inspired
generations.

The book is brief and compact, with only 110 pages... even sometimes
found in a locket format. It can be read in a single night of peace and quiet.
Many initiates in the holy order read the work every night for an entire
year.

If an intact copy of _Castigere’s Meditations_ is acquired....

- Gain +2 magic skill after reading for the fi rst time
- Rolls to cast Healing Touch ignore penalties
- After three readings, gain a Sermon skill at 9. This skill can be used to
    inspire, rally, or soothe large groups of people using Castigere’s words
    and concepts.
- After ten readings, gain a Commune with Ghosts skill at 9. With this
    skill, roll to talk to, calm, interview, or bargain with the dead, ghosts,
    or zombies.

‘If it ain’t fat, salt, sugar, beer or bread, it don’t matter! Oh yeah, veggies
are good, too. You come lookin’ to learn the Gamgoodle family secrets?
All those tasty tidbits at the banquet and hefty barbies on the road? Well,
come in close, folks. I’m about to spill the beans.’
```
Felbo Gamgoodle is the most famous chef in The North Holds. The exact
years he was alive are somewhat of a mystery, as several impostors and
recipe thieves have taken his identity at various times, claiming culinary
supremacy before being exposed, vilifi ed, and shunned.

The Gamgoodle Recipes are collected in a bulky libram, the most authentic
copies string-bound on silver rings with wooden cover plates. The pages
are a waxed parchment, resistant to stains, heat, and submersion. The
expert can use this special construction to identify forgeries and fakes.

The book has numerous treats to offer readers, if acquired...

- Once a few days are spent with the book, gain a +5 Cooking skill
- After a week of recipe practice gain the skill ‘Chef.’ Whenever you
    cook food or drink, double its benefi ts and value.
- Forage-to-Table: Once the chef skill is acquired, you can also double

‘If it ain’t fat, salt, sugar, beer or bread, it don’t matter! Oh yeah, veggies
are good, too. You come lookin’ to learn the Gamgoodle family secrets?
All those tasty tidbits at the banquet and hefty barbies on the road? Well,
come in close, folks. I’m about to spill the beans.’
```
Felbo Gamgoodle is the most famous chef in The North Holds. The exact
years he was alive are somewhat of a mystery, as several impostors and
recipe thieves have taken his identity at various times, claiming culinary
supremacy before being exposed, vilifi ed, and shunned.

The Gamgoodle Recipes are collected in a bulky libram, the most authentic
copies string-bound on silver rings with wooden cover plates. The pages
are a waxed parchment, resistant to stains, heat, and submersion. The
expert can use this special construction to identify forgeries and fakes.

###### T he Morut

```
‘You will walk the liquid sand, you will see the glass pillars of serpent
kingdoms, you will see the seven-eyed skull, you will wander the
fi ngerprint canyons of the worm-god. For each soul you lend the storm,
so will death reveal himself. One need only listen; the book will speak.’
```
The Morut is shrouded in myth. The book itself is iron-bound with snake-
skin covers and burnished brass fi ttings. So coveted by dark forces is
this book that no known copy is fully intact. In fact, if a copy is acquired
without scores of sword-cuts, bloodstains and a scent of death... it is likely
a fake. The pages are found blank on fi rst viewing. Only when a _sentient
life_ is offered up to the book will its text appear, one spell at a time.

**Rot of Dead Fingers:** Sacrifi ce 1D4 skills _permanently_ to cast once. The
rot is a black decay that affl icts all those in your view. They will die in D8
ROUNDS, passing the rot as contagion to any they touch in that time, and
so on until it runs its course.

**Death Seed:** Suffer 1D4 attrition _permanently_ to cast once. Create a
smooth, dark red object akin to a pine nut. If eaten, this seed will kill within
1D4 days. There is no known cure for this affl iction besides the blessing of
a Reverend Mother at Fairfi eld Abbey.

**Casket of Chronos:** Sacrifi ce 1 skill permanently to cast once. This spell
creates a glass coffi n. Its occupant will never decay. Living occupants are
placed in suspended animation until released by the caster.

**The Word of Sett:** Etch a word into living fl esh. The subject so marked will
carry this word out with all its effort until the end of its days. Performing
the marking requires 1) casting the spell and 2) 2D6 PHASES writing time.

**Host of Serpents:** Call forth a vast legion of snakes, which emerge from
the ground. They will do your bidding until destroyed.

**Mummifi ed Servant:** Cast this spell on any dead thing. It is dried, cured,
toughened, and risen anew, and will obey your commands until destroyed.

###### S tein’s Mechanics and Engineering Field Guide

```
‘Through proper practice with the hands, not the mind, the mechanic
acquires an intuitive skill with building, repair, machines, and carpentry.
This guide includes the fundamentals for diagnosis, identifi cation, repair
and construction of most known structures and devices.’
```
Stein’s Mechanics has been used for centuries in The Holds by craftsmen
and smiths to build and develop all manner of invention, from gates to
rotary locks, to iron hinges, to millworks and suspension carriages.

This book is written in direct language, with a wealth of diagrams to aid the
practitioner. Thus, it does not require special translation or study, simply
time and effort in the form of hero points. Each benefi t can only be gained
once. The tome can be read in any order, focusing on any segment.

**3 points:** Gain a +3 to your Repair skill. This allows rapid repair of all
common mechanics, masonry and carpentry. It differs from a common-
knowledge skill in that its results are instant.

**3 points:** With the aid of the book, you learn chemical and surface
treatments for wood, leather, and metal that can halt rot, rust, or corrosion
instantly. This is a skill that simply requires 1 PHASE of your attention to
apply.

**5 points:** The secrets of a builder. With a Magic roll, quickly create
structures or braces with wood and stone. Expect penalties with complexity.

**5 points:** The secrets of an inventor. Use magic to quickly devise and create
small gadgets or gear modifi cations, with GM collaboration.

**10 points:** Here, the somewhat dark humor of Stein is revealed. His most
advanced teachings concern _disassembly_. Upon investment, gain the skill
‘Linchpin’ at value 9. Rapidly identify a single weak point or fastener
in masonry, carpentry, or mechanical construction. Stein mentions _‘the
judicious use of a block hammer’_ to instantly apply this destructive skill.

###### M agna Cryptica

```
‘In the nest of the Tomb Spider, one expects to fi nd human carrion,
mummifi ed birds and other horrors. The naturalist is encouraged to take
heed with such exploits, as the Tomb Spider also stores most of its brain
in the nest webs. This truly bizarre adaptation keeps the core awareness
safely stashed while the bulky body searches for prey, or lies in wait for
decades... content and inert in this strange state.’
```
This expansive work is found in a series of fi eld guides and chapbooks,
never properly assembled in a single volume, even to the present day.
Mostly, the Cryptica is found in ‘collections’ of such materials, few of them
complete. The text is always added to and modifi ed as new data becomes
available. Its singular topic: monsters.

Adventurers will most likely come across the Magna Cryptica one or
two monster entries at a time. When this occurs, the reader is given full
information, as far as the GM is capable, on the monster(s) in question.

With additional time and attention, the Cryptica can reveal even deeper
cryptological theorems, such as likely nesting locations, reproductive
behaviors, genealogies, and bio-chemical aspects. These can be applied
in a myriad of creative ways for the monster hunter, naturalist or breeder.

Though the Magna Cryptica provides no mechanical advantage to its
masters in combat, The GM is encouraged to reduce or negate penalties
when facing well-studied monsters.
