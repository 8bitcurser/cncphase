### A rush of snowy wind rolled over the wagon-cover. The canvas was

frozen solid, making a perfect rooftop. A few feet buried, and the inside
would be cozy as a Proudfoot moss-cabin. Within, huddling around a
coalstone for warmth, were two elves. Their ears were all but blue. Both
shivered, but both acted as if the cold was little more than a nuisance.
There was no room for weakness here, no room for distraction.

“They’ll be upon us any moment, Elthas. They seem unphased by the cold.”
“Then enjoy these moments and mind your blade, husband.” The tone was
a form of humor only they understood. Celbrin smiled.
“The orb is no doubt in our lady’s hands by now.”
“Then mission accomplished, warrior,” Elthas was taller than her husband,
thin as a sapling, wrapped in heavy chain and winter tabard. She couldn’t
help but laugh a bit. They had seen the impossible done, trusting each other,
enduring more than anyone could know in the depths of the mountain.
These moments between them were worth every drop of blood, every cut,
every scrape, and those were many. She loved him in that moment, more
than ever.
“What?”
“Nothing, you oaf. One more kiss before we’re cut to ribbons?” He obliged
her, then grabbed her scabbard belt and pulled.
“Two.”

What happened next is told and retold in taverns and stage houses throughout
the realm. It’s a chronicle with no shortage of mythic versions, tragedies,
and battle-hymns. Elthas and Celbrin... the ghosts of Harnmoor Pass.

The title, of course, serves as a foreshadow. Vicious snow-orcs, pale-
skinned, clad in copper-trimmed armor, with steel bow strings and ten-foot
spears, swarmed the little wagon. They charged through the drifts, barely
noticing chest-deep snow, twenty strong, splitting into two teams, each
with shield fi ghter, archers, and spears in formation. This was no rabble, no
skirmish... it was a death squad.

“Well, they’re here at last. Are you ready?”
“This is true love, my deadly little twig. Let them come.”


### Elvish blade-masters are a thing seldom seen. In this moment, on the ice-

scoured heights of Harnmoor, at the eastern gateway of Ullur’s Teeth, the
ancient and deadly art of elven swordplay was on full display. They spun,
and sliced, and held ground back-to-back. Each was pierced a thousand
times by ragged orc blades, but still they bled and fought, graceful, terrible,
ripping throats and severing limbs, each cut more savage than the last, both
of them in a death’s embrace undaunted.

Then they died.

Decades have hidden their dire mission. Whatever doom was brewing was
averted. Generations lived on without them, and their names appeared in
tomes and chronciles of the age. The story was told again and again. Even
frog-kin wrote poems of the husband and wife at Harnmoor Pass.

A century later, a team of Harnmoor dwarves were cutting the capital road
used to this day. Fifty stout folk in all were they, snow-caked, ice-blind,
working day and night to cut a causeway in the bedrock.

“Gus! Look there!”
“Eh? Another weird bird?”
“No, you git! Look! By the teeth, it’s them!”

No stout folk wishes to see ghosts. They have a skin-crawling response to
the living dead and the echoes they inhabit, but there it was. Every one of
them lifted their goggles, dropped their picks, straightened their backs.

There was no mistaking it: two elves, there but little more than tricks of
light. No matter how much the dwarves wanted it unseen, there they were,
and they were dancing.

An eerie song lifted on the wind. He held her gently, hand on her little
waist, and they spun, slow and gliding like sparrows over a chimney. She
bent away from him and returned, and they exchanged tender kisses that
would alight like snow on stone. They were weightless, infi nite, perfect...
rays of sun in the freeze, and then they were gone.

## The Path of MagicThe Path of MagicThe Path of MagicThe Path of Magic

### If you have turned to this page, you are a seeker of hidden truths. Not

content to carry steel and arrow, you are drawn to the dark arts, the magic
power that criss-crosses the multiverse. You are one who would walk the
‘semitae arcanum...’ the path of magic. Players are, of course, encouraged
to use the spell rules and lists provided in the Player’s Guide. This section
offers a deeper look, with a more comprehensive progression for the player.

**Sorcerer-Just the Basics:** Sorcerers are those magic-users who rely on
an intuitive sense for arcane power. They memorize gestures and words to
evoke magic, eschewing books and baubles. This is the ‘born with the gift’
type spell caster, simply winging it by a gut feeling.

- Acquire spells from the Basic Spells List
- Spells occupy no inventory, stored in memory alone
- Enhance or acquire additional spells in simple rest and safety
- Cannot create or use Custom Spells
- Commonly uses herbalism to augment capabilities

**Mage-Custom Spells Expert:** Mage is a nickname given to those who
press the frontiers of magical theory. This is the knowledge-seeker, library
dweller... one who believes rational thought can harness the arcane.

- Build custom spells with any method desired
- Spells can be bound to inventory, or not, depending on build details
- Enhance or acquire additional spells only with specialized magical
    facilities, books, magical scholars, rest and safety

**Wizard-The Path-Walker:** A wizard is a rare and misunderstood thing...
a child of the elements, a dimension-strider, a being whose innate nature
is magical for good, ill, or both. Though always old and wizened in
appearance, wizards have strangely ‘young’ souls... sometimes forgetful of
their own origins, purpose, or even name.

- Required to take the Ancient fl aw
- Acquire spells and abilities along one of three paths. Unlock these
    ‘advancements’ with hero points (read on in this section)
- Spells will feature a variety of inventory variants
- Enhance spells or accelerate path advancements with a tattoo


### The Wizard, as described and played here, is a unique phenomenon in

CROWN and SKULL, defi ned by preset paths of progression. When you
set out to play a Wizard, you will choose one of three paths to pursue, and
develop along _that path only_ for the lifetime of the character. Choose one
path below when you create your Wizard character, then fl ip to that path
to get started.

**Starfallen:** Some wizards are not born... they fall from the stars. These
beings are envoys of hidden gods, incarnations of world-guardians, or a
living coalescence of nature’s arcane spirit.

- Your background is hazy... a form of amnesia plagues the Starfallen
- You are a force of good, though still feel the lure of evil
- You prefer odd herbs, teas, and tinctures to normal food

**Ancient One:** The deepest secrets of magic take centuries to unlock. By
magical means, you have prolonged your life long enough to reach the
most obscure levels of spell-craft.

- You are sometimes absent-minded, pondering other things
- You are mostly neutral on moral matters
- You are drawn to books and scrolls by a passion for knowledge

**Demonologist:** You see power in the infernal, certain that the darkness can
be made a servant. This darkness you perilously tap for your power, always
an inch from the wrath of inhuman evils.

- You have a shadowy view of things... seeing more snakes than angels
- Your moral stance in unclear, but unafraid of the dark side
- You have a drinking or smoking habit that helps keep the dark at bay

```
Wizards? They have their uses, I suppose. Fighting
men and good steel may win the day, but it’s
always wizards facing the hidden causes of
things. Handy as a friend, sure, but unpredictable
in the fi eld. Oh, and never get them drunk!

### Long have you toiled in dark towers and dusty libraries. Long have you

    end of this time, your physical form will ‘jump’ to the phasic self, no
    matter what may lie between.

**Tier 3 Advancements**
_12 points each, must have at least 2 Tier 2 Advancements to access_

**- Quartz Arrow:** This spell conjures a single arrow of smoky crystal. It
    is a 2D12 weapon, fi red with any bow. If infl icting over 10 damage, it
    kills its victim instantly. Carry only 1 such arrow at a time.
**- Korum’s Chains:** Cast this spell on a victim at range to bind them
    where they stand. For each round they do not escape the chains, they
    constrict for D10 damage.
**- Goat Form:** Take the appearance of a terrifying half-goat humanoid
    creature. You can only make this transformation in a place no one can
    see you do it. The goat form is a horror to behold, even for allies.
**- Brazier of Ghosts:** An iron incense-lantern that emits a thin coil of
    smoke. Use a Magic skill roll over a fresh corpse to capture its ghost.
    Stored ghosts, up to 3, can be called forth as incorporeal entities, able
    to make sounds and deliver a chilling D12 melee attack. They dissipate
    after 1D4 rounds.


## Scribed in Flesh

### For a Wizard to enhance or accelerate their mysterious growth in power,

they are sometimes willing to press the bounds of dimensions, making
contact with otherworldly entities, demigods, immortals, or even the dead.
When this occurs, a tattoo is seared into the fl esh of the practitioner, ever
scarring them as a cost paid for such dangerous arrangements.

**Making a Bargain:** In time, the Wizard will be pondering advancement...
a research project, a visit from a mentor, or access to arcane tomes may
be at hand. In this state, the ambitious or desperate Wizard may ask _“do I
dare invite greater forces to hasten this process?”_ If the answer is yes, the
player should propose a bargain with the GM.

**- Contacting the Arcanum:** A bargain as described here is made between
    the wizard seeking power and the semi-sentient demigod of magic
    energy called The Arcanum. It speaks in a booming voice, shakes the
    walls, and demands reverence. _“What can you offer?”_
**- Overspend:** If a bargain is struck in rest and safety, the wizard is granted
    3 hero points, to be used immediately on the advancement desired. This
    boost in spending power can either access high cost advancements OR
    be used to upgrade an advancement.
**- Gain During Action:** If a bargain is struck, the wizard may be granted
    an advancement during action scenes, rather than with safety and rest
    as usual. In such a case, the advancement is purchased and granted
    instantly, but cannot gain the ‘Overspend’ benefi t.

**The Tattoo:** Once a bargain is struck with The Arcanum, and the
advancement gained, the wizard is subjected to a painful ordeal of tattooing.

- This mark ‘contains’ the acquired advancement. If it is destroyed or
    lost (with a loss of limb, for example) the advancement will be lost.
- The tattoo takes 1D4 rounds to burn into the wizard’s fl esh. During
    this process, no other actions may be taken. The wizard will grunt and
    strain with agony, staying quiet only with Resist rolls.
- A ‘bargain’ tattoo is seen as a dark omen by many magic users,
    townspeople, and nobles. If detected, it will cause unfavorable
    responses from such folk. There may even be schools of magical study
    or certain academic locations that will deny entry if the tattoo is seen.

### Eager to reach greater powers, Wizards may choose to bind themselves

to another as an offering. Unlike a bargain, the tether is a deal made for
_future_ service or cost. Often nicknamed the ‘Rumplestiltskin Effect,’ this
arrangement risks future debt for immediate gain, embodied on the seeker
in the form of a tattoo. As long as the tattoo endures, the tether remains.

**Forming a Tether:** In time, the Wizard will meet powerful magical beings
such as elementals, wraiths, demons, dimensional entities, or even dragons.
At this moment, the ambitious or desperate Wizard may ask _“do I dare
make an oath to this creature to claim a piece of its power?”_ If the answer
is yes, the player should speak with the GM and propose a tether.

**- Word is Bond:** A tether is an oath to a magic being. In return for power
    promised, the wizard MUST answer a future call for service. As such,
    tethers can only be made with intelligent creatures that can speak.
    Usually, such an offer benefi ts the master more than the servant.
**- Overspend:** If a tether is set in rest and safety, the wizard is granted 3
    hero points, to be used immediately on the advancement desired. This
    boost in spending power can either access high cost advancements OR
    be used to upgrade an advancement.
**- Gain During Action:** If a tether is set, the wizard may be granted an
    advancement during action scenes, rather than with safety and rest
    as usual. In such a case, the advancement is purchased and granted
    instantly, but cannot gain the ‘Overspend’ benefi t.

**The Tattoo:** The tether is a deal struck over future service. Thus, the
master requires assurances that this debt will not be welched or avoided.
The tether tattoo enforces this agreement.

- Once service is called, the servant has 1D4 rounds to begin to comply.
    This may mean travel or a specifi c deed or task.
- If service isn’t given, the tattoo will burn with pain. This pain infl icts
    1D4 skill attrition per round until the wizard complies, but cannot kill
    its subject. Recovered skills will burn away again instantly.
- Once service is rendered, the tattoo disappears. If the tattoo is destroyed
    or removed by limb loss, the tether will be broken, but its master may
    be displeased and appear or pursue for retribution.

## Divine Magic

### Wizards and their kind draw power by comprehension, intuition, and

methodology. The user of divine magic, by contrast, places their trust in
higher beings... offering themselves as mere conduits for deifi c blessings
and miracles. The means of this transfer of power is a complete mystery.
This mystery has a name: _faith_.

**Finding Your Faith:** By spending 3 or more points on a Faith skill,
your character begins to look within, quieting the mind to seek divine
communion. This link with one or more deities grows stronger over time.

**- Roll Faith to Cast:** Once you have pledged yourself to one or more
    deities, you may use your Faith skill in place of a Magic skill to avoid
    unstable effects or as a magical resistance.
**- Gain Faith:** The Faith skill is highly variable. It has its current value,
    paid for in hero points, but increases by 1 with each successful cast of
    any healing, protection, or blessing type magic. Faith cannot increase
    in this way beyond skill value 14.
**- Lose Faith:** When a casting roll, using Faith, is failed, you feel a
    painful distance from your deity. All bonus gained from ‘gaining faith’
    is lost instantly, returning your skill to its base value. Some locations
    and infernal foes may also deliver this cruel effect.
**- Deities:** In The North Holds, there are many deities worshipped by
    peoples of all kinds. So many, in fact, that it is diffi cult to list any
    standouts. The player is encouraged to choose and name their own
    deity, immortal, divine patron or saint.

**The Holy Symbol:** To cast with Faith, the practitioner must have a sacred
object, amulet, relic, or symbol associated with their deity and way of life.
This symbol is held aloft when casting. The symbol can gain up to 3 effects,
costing 3 points each, purchased at any time.

**- Light of the Divine:** Emit a small light, comparable to a torch, for 1D
    rounds. Roll Faith immediately to keep this spell from being expended.
**- Evilbane:** Truly evil entities cannot touch you or those within arm’s
    reach of you as long as the symbol is held aloft. Exhausting to cast.
**- Beacon:** Focus your mind on the symbol and reach out to anyone you
    know. They know your location at any distance. Exhausting to cast.

### Once a priest, cleric, monk, or even paladin has earned a total of 15

points in play, they may begin to walk The Holy Path. This is a way of life
that leaves no room for selfi shness, compromise, or earthly concerns. The
player is encouraged to role play this way of life. Additionally, they will
gain access to Prayer and the Holy Order.

**Prayer:** As the divine conduit grows in wisdom and the ability to channel
their patron, they may relinquish control and comprehension of their magic
entirely in the form of _prayer_.

**- Taking Time to Pray:** To pray to a deity, distant and powerful, the
    practitioner must close their eyes and clasp their holy symbol. In this
    state they must remain for 1D4 rounds. At the end of the prayer, they
    must roll their Faith skill to earn a miracle.
**- Miracles:** Divine will manifests in unexpected ways. Upon a successful
    request for a miracle, the faithful must offer some explanation of their
    hopes. The GM will then take the reins, offering the divine intervention
    as they see fi t.

**The Holy Order:** Unlike a typical supplicant of The Holy Order, you will
be offered a special place once you walk The Holy Path.

**- A High Priest:** Once you walk the path, the next abbey or place of
    worship you visit will include a High Priest to take you in as a loyal
    aspirant. You will be asked to make a solemn vow to this person, and
    offer your life to their service.
**- Safe Haven:** In exchange for your service thus promised, you and your
    allies can always treat holy sites as places of rest and safety, even in
    enemy territory. A humble shrine can become a fortress.

**Divine Lord:** Once you have earned 50 or more points in play, you will
be awarded a stronghold, abbey, or holy site as your own, and proclaimed
Divine Lord of that area. This title will earn you land, equipment stores,
a few loyal servants, and invitations from various dignitaries. For many,
the path to king begins with becoming a divine lord, while others retreat
into meditation for decades. The Holy Path is different for each one of the
faithful, for the divine is a truth of many truths.

## Wild Magic

### Whether you be a priest, monk, starfallen wizard, druid, bard, or

librarian mage, there is a school of the arcane that can be tapped at any
time, if the practitioner can contain the energies at play: _wild magic._ While
tremendously versatile, wild magic is also unstable, formless... with a will
of its own. The guidelines for casting this way are as follows...

**Conjuring a Wild Spell:** A skilled player has a command of the effects and
limitations found in the Custom Spells section. With this as a loose guideline,
the user of wild magic _conjures_ a spell from nothing... improvising on the
spot to _conceive of_ a spell-like outcome of magic power. Consulting briefl y
with the GM to confi rm the details and outputs of the spell, they are ready
to cast.

```
CONJURING A WILD SPELL REQUIRES 1 FULL TURN
```
_*Note: Conjuring wild spells can eat undue amounts of time at the table,
unless practiced by an experienced player. As GM or player, be sure to
avoid overusing table time to determine spell details_.

**Casting a Wild Spell:** Once a wild spell has been conjured, and the GM is
in accord, it is ready to cast. Roughly speaking, apply the rule below. This
is the only way to cast Wild Magic.

```
TO CAST A WILD SPELL, ROLL MAGIC SKILL WITH THE
SPELL VALUE AS A PENALTY
```
_*Example: If a wild spell has total value of 9 points, roll Magic-9 or less
on D20 to cast. If the spell value exceeds the Magic skill, it cannot be cast._

**Losing Control:** If a wild spell cast roll is failed, roll 1D4 here:
**1:** Caster suffers fl esh attrition and is stunned 1 full round
**2:** Caster suffers fl esh attrition and cannot use magic for 1D4 rounds
**3:** Desired effect is achieved, but in an opposite form
**4:** Fizzles and sparks cause nearby enemies to focus on the caster

### Once a magic-using character has earned 15 points in play, they can

begin a study of antimagic. This method seeks to nullify, cancel, or remove
magic rather than channel it. To learn any of the abilities listed here, the
practitioner must have access to magical research facilities, no matter their
style or path. Antimagic is a closely guarded secret, and not easily learned.

**Cost:** The abilities below are not spells. They are learned skills, thus
costing 1 point per value, maximum 18, minimum 3. Each requires the
recitation of arcane words, but no gestures.

_*Note: If any of these skill rolls are failed, the target magic is beyond the
practitioner’s ability to nullify and no follow-up attempts may be made on
that specifi cally targeted effect._

**Dispel Magic:** Temporarily nullify a specifi c aspect of magic or single
arcane effect on a person or object. Target magic is dispelled for 1D
rounds. Roll this skill to earn this effect.

**Destroy Magic:** Once Dispel Magic is learned at 9 or greater value, pay 5
points to supplement it with this add-on ability. Similar to dispel, but effect
targeted is permanently nullifi ed. If attempted on ancient magic, or effects
cast by powerful elder beings, liches, or similar, roll with a -5 penalty.

**Counterspell:** Your skill with magical language allows you to mimic and
intercept a spell microseconds after it is cast, preventing its effect. You can
only use this skill if you have a phase of action in the current round that is
yet unused. In that case, roll the moment the target spell is cast, and forfeit
your upcoming phase. If using against powerful elder beings, liches, or
similar, roll with a -5 penalty.

**Antimagic Sphere:** Using markings and arcane words, you can scribe
a circular area: magic will not function within that area. Roll this skill
to create such an area, 10’ across, for 1D4 rounds. Roll this skill at a -
penalty to establish the area for as long as your scribed circle is intact, even
if that be days, years, or centuries.
